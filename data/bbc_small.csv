Sweet Love;How, in the 70s and 80s, bedroom soul was born to soften soul's hard edges.;How, in the 70s and 80s, a second coming of soul men offered a black female audience slow jams and sexual healing.;"How, in the 70s and 80s, a second coming of soul men, led by Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye and Luther Vandross, offered a black female audience slow jams and sexual healing. 

In the early 70s, Memphis was the capital of gospel-infused soul music, thanks to two key labels. One was Stax, the other was Hi Records - a high church of soul presided over by Al Green whose Let’s Stay Together pre-figured a new type of soul man, one who would come to dominate the 70s - a sensitive lover man.

In Philadelphia, a new record label was born that would also soften soul’s hard edges. Philadelphia International Records was home to Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, from whose ranks Teddy Pendergrass would emerge. PIR was also home to the O’Jays, who embodied Philadelphia’s message of love and togetherness.

Fresh from the monumental success of What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye went to work on his follow-up, shifting focus from the streets to the bedroom with Let’s Get It On. Bedroom soul was also epitomised by the sensitive, thoughtful Barry White, whose deep baritone put both black and white audiences in the mood. 

In the mid-70s, disco became a lucrative sideline for female singers who delivered first-hand songs about love, loss and empowerment such as Candi Staton’s Young Hearts Run Free, whilst Millie Jackson did what the soul men did, only more so, telling it like it was. 

This episode also looks at the Quiet Storm radio format, conceived by billionaire entrepreneur Cathy Hughes, targeted at a black female audience. The title was borrowed from Smokey Robinson’s 1975 album of laid-back soul ballads, and the genre helped make stars of artists such as Peabo Bryson, whose smooth ballads led the listener discretely to the bedroom door.

The tragic death of Marvin Gaye, on the back of his biggest success - Sexual Healing - and the paralysis of Teddy Pendergrass seemed like bad omens for soul in the 80s. But one artist filled the gap. New York-born Luther Vandross started out as one of the most in-demand backing vocalists before redefining soul with Never Too Much. Luther may have been the 80s soul king, but he did not rule alone. Anita Baker was the queen. Her 1986 hit album Rapture pursued a similar, contemporary yet retro take on soul. 

However, Luther couldn’t hold back the tide forever. The birth of hip hop as a political force and the arrival of MTV closed the door on soul, ushering in a new era for black music. The soul epoch may have been over, but the music never went away and, from time to time, it resurfaces in all its glory.  

With The O’Jays, Al ‘Fonzi’ Thornton, Marcus Miller, Nat Adderley Jr, Jerry Cummings, Charles Hodges, Candi Staton, Peabo Bryson, Millie Jackson and Cathy Hughes. Expert analysis from Mark Anthony Neal, David Ritz and Nelson George.

Formed in London, the band was comprised of Boy George on vocals, Mikey Craig on bass, Roy Hay on guitar and keyboards and Jon Moss on drums. As well as their UK success, the band was huge in the USA - notching up ten top 40 hits. Being part of Band Aid cemented them as stalwarts of the 80s, a band that broke down barriers and left a huge legacy for the stars that came later, before they disbanded in 1986.  

However, they are a band with a past as colourful as their music. George had a secret affair with his drummer Jon Moss and when they acrimoniously split, the band fell apart and George descended into heroin addiction. Over the years there have been numerous failed attempts to reunite the band.
 
In 2014 Culture Club decided to come back together to record a new album and embark on a UK and US tour. Director Mike Nicholls has unique access, following the band as they first meet in George's London home to write new material. However, it's not long before creative differences and tensions from their past begin to emerge. Faultlines develop further when the band travel to Spain to record the new album, spending two weeks working and living together in a remote recording studio. 

As the band return to London to prepare for the tour, they suffer a Twitter mauling after their first big public performance on Strictly Come Dancing. Relations are even more strained when George and the band sign to separate managers and a sudden illness threatens the whole reunion.

With contributions from Sting, Elvis Costello and Dave Stewart.;"Brit Award winner Sam Fender goes in search of a musical hero from another era - the late, great, Alan Hull of Lindisfarne. Sam is amazed how few people, outside of his native north east, know much about his hero’s work. He’s now on a mission to win back Hull’s place in music history.

In this film, he traces the career of the man whose words and music put Newcastle and supergroup Lindisfarne on the musical map in the 1970s. Alan continued to write classic songs until his early death in 1995. He spoke of love and life, championed the underdog and the misunderstood, and celebrated working-class people and his hometown - both of which he loved with a passion. Alan lived and wrote through turbulent times - writing eloquently about the troubles in Northern Ireland, the Falklands War and the miners’ strike.

Sam digs out great archive interviews, performances and unseen footage, and meets friends, family and bandmates who knew Alan Hull best. Sam also hears from top stars like Sting, Elvis Costello, Mark Knopfler, Dave Stewart and Peter Gabriel. All were huge fans of songs such as Lady Eleanor, Fog on the Tyne, Winter Song, Clear White Light and Run For Home. But he also finds that Alan inspired an entire new generation of musicians like Kay Greyson: a young rapper from Tyneside.

And, with the final on 11 July taking place on the hallowed turf of Wembley, football really is coming home this summer.
 
In We Are England, Krept and Konan, two of the UK’s most talented and successful rap artists, are setting out to mark what is sure to be a huge shared cultural moment by making a track to celebrate the England football team. But first they need to investigate what Englishness actually means in 2021. It’s never been a simple question for those of non-white British heritage, but it’s a question they’ll need to tackle if they are going to create an authentic track to celebrate the national squad.  
 
Because instead of the traditional cheesy sing-along, featuring a former soap actor or long-retired left-back, Krept and Konan are going to create an anthem for our times: representing the modern diversity and forward-looking culture in which our chart-topping rap stars and the young stars of the England team are cut from the same cloth. Rap culture is the culture of young Britain, and today’s top-tier teams now move to a whole different beat than they did when the Three Lions anthem of Euros 96 had them tapping their toes in the changing rooms and their fans chanting on the terraces. The lifestyle, attitude, slang and swagger of rap culture is replicated in the national football team – itself now one of the youngest and most diverse it has ever been – and many of the country’s biggest rappers came up honing their football skills and their rap lyrics on our city streets and in the ‘cages’ of the UK’s estates, just as top footballers grew up surrounded by hip hop culture, looking up to rap stars.  
 
So if they’re going to create a track to celebrate the pride of a new nation, it’s these stories that Krept and Konan want to tell, and this bold, aspirational culture they want to reflect. On their journey into exploring national identity, they hit the road, striking out beyond the streets of the capital as they get to know the England squad, meeting players including Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Aston Villa’s Tyrone Mings and West Ham’s Declan Rice as well as retired Lioness legend, Eni Aluko. They also seek advice from fellow artists including chart-topping Manchester rapper Aitch who they meet at Old Trafford, and west London rapper Big Zuu as they watch some football anthems from days gone by to see just how much our national culture has changed. They also go to St George’s Park, home of the England team, where they get an exclusive audience with England manager Gareth Southgate to find out what ingredients he’d like to see making it into the final song.";Sport;BBC THREE;Contains some strong language.;2021;57;music, sports, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09kbnm3.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09kbnm3.jpg;emerge sunlight long shadow lockdown uefa euro tournament june one world ’ highly anticipated sporting event final 11 july taking place hallowed turf wembley football really coming home summer england krept konan two uk ’ talented successful rap artist setting mark sure huge shared cultural moment making track celebrate england football team first need investigate englishness actually mean 2021 ’ never simple question nonwhite british heritage ’ question ’ need tackle going create authentic track celebrate national squad instead traditional cheesy singalong featuring former soap actor longretired leftback krept konan going create anthem time representing modern diversity forwardlooking culture charttopping rap star young star england team cut cloth rap culture culture young britain today ’ toptier team move whole different beat three lion anthem euro 96 tapping toe changing room fan chanting terrace lifestyle attitude slang swagger rap culture replicated national football team – one youngest diverse ever – many country ’ biggest rapper came honing football skill rap lyric city street ‘ cage ’ uk ’ estate top footballer grew surrounded hip hop culture looking rap star ’ going create track celebrate pride new nation ’ story krept konan want tell bold aspirational culture want reflect journey exploring national identity hit road striking beyond street capital get know england squad meeting player including everton ’ dominic calvertlewin aston villa ’ tyrone ming west ham ’ declan rice well retired lioness legend eni aluko also seek advice fellow artist including charttopping manchester rapper aitch meet old trafford west london rapper big zuu watch football anthem day gone see much national culture changed also go st george ’ park home england team get exclusive audience england manager gareth southgate find ingredient ’ like see making final song;5

It's an irreverent and witty exploration into one man's obsessions, a bohemian life lived on the New York fringes and a uniquely twisted take on the American dream. 

Bob Dylan once said 'I don't think I'm gonna be really understood until maybe 100 years from now'. Author of the Dylan To English Dictionary, a Dylanologist and originator of garbology (the practice of rooting through rubbish in order to gain insight into prominent people's lives), Weberman has made it his life's work to understand Dylan.

At times both hilarious and disturbing, the film is not only a great companion piece to Scorsese's No Direction Home but an interesting observation on our unbalanced desires to know more about celebrities and how far we are willing to go to get that information or even become a part of their lives. 

Weberman does not see himself as a stalker and insists that Dylan should be grateful that he is around: 'how was I to know I would have been to Dylan what Verlaine was to Rimbaud'. It's hard to see this as a tale of poet and critic, but rather a look at the bizarre relationship between the obsessed and the object of his obsession and how it can completely take over a man's life. 

Beginning in the 1960s when Dylan was at the height of his early fame and regarded as something close to a prophet or a seer by the American counter-culture, Weberman has sought to try and climb inside Dylan's head by going through his rubbish. Back then he pursued his obsession relentlessly.

An amusing telephone conversation between Weberman and Dylan, recorded in the 1970s, punctuates the film in the form of animations, creating connections between Weberman's past and present.

The film also features an unforgettable cast of supporting characters close to Weberman, including New York street singer David Peel, former child dancer Jay Byrd and Aaron Kay aka 'The Pieman', and enjoys a vivid Americana soundtrack performed by cast members, adding an extra veneer of strangeness to Weberman and his universe.";Documentary;BBC FOUR;Contains strong language.;2011;76;music, from-the-archives, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09htx2m.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09htx2m.jpg;documentary chronicling life time crime notorious bob dylan obsessive garbology inventor aj weberman irreverent witty exploration one man obsession bohemian life lived new york fringe uniquely twisted take american dream bob dylan said dont think im gon na really understood maybe 100 year author dylan english dictionary dylanologist originator garbology practice rooting rubbish order gain insight prominent people life weberman made life work understand dylan time hilarious disturbing film great companion piece scorsese direction home interesting observation unbalanced desire know celebrity far willing go get information even become part life weberman see stalker insists dylan grateful around know would dylan verlaine rimbaud hard see tale poet critic rather look bizarre relationship obsessed object obsession completely take man life beginning 1960s dylan height early fame regarded something close prophet seer american counterculture weberman sought try climb inside dylan head going rubbish back pursued obsession relentlessly amusing telephone conversation weberman dylan recorded 1970s punctuates film form animation creating connection webermans past present film also feature unforgettable cast supporting character close weberman including new york street singer david peel former child dancer jay byrd aaron kay aka pieman enjoys vivid americana soundtrack performed cast member adding extra veneer strangeness weberman universe;16

It is also the story of how the talents of a golden generation of artists were forever preserved on film. Nupen came from an unlikely background in South Africa and ‘ticked none of the boxes’, but seizing upon the emerging camera technology and his unique access, he filmed classical music in a completely new and intimate way that broke down the barriers between artists and their public. As a result, this documentary is also an important story about the history of music on television and the great artists who collaborated on the films. 
  
Now 86, Nupen reflects on 75 productions about artists and composers spanning more than 50 years. His body of work convincingly enforces his conviction that television is capable of remembering artists in a way that no other medium can equal. Oxford philosopher and historian Sir Isaiah Berlin described Nupen’s films as being ‘at just about the highest level which television is capable of reaching’.

The programme cherry-picks examples of Christopher Nupen’s best work between 1966 and 2017. When he started, he instinctively blended documentary and musical performance to create a new genre of film. He filmed musicians at close quarters in their natural environment, where they have most to offer. Television picked up the exuberant spirit of the new generation and carried it far and wide. The effects were dramatic and brought countless numbers of people to music for the first time.

A musician himself, Nupen’s musical friends were among the most-renowned artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Capturing their unique talents on film, we relive sublime historical moments with the likes of Daniel Barenboim, Pinchas Zukerman, Andrès Segovia, John Williams, Nathan Milstein, Placido Domingo, Itzhak Perlman, Jacqueline du Pré, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Evgeny Kissin and Daniil Trifonov.

A number of deadlines set by the British and Irish governments for the establishment of the executive pass without success.

This year’s events in Llangollen combine new commissions from Catrin Finch and Paul Mealor, performed both online and in the famous pavilion, with a remarkable artwork that decorates the old bridge at the heart of the town. It climaxes in possibly the biggest musical event in Wales since the pandemic began.

The international performers may not be able to travel to Llangollen this year, but a new dance track has been created by singer-songwriter Lily Beau and rapper Magugu. Shared on TikTok, it invites dancers the world over to take part. 

Catrin Finch has been working on a new commission combining harp with Indian tabla percussion and traditional wooden flutes. Add in beatboxer Mr Phormula and the Cardiff Oasis refugee choir, and the result is a piece that reflects the international outlook of the eisteddfod.

Luke Jerman is an internationally renowned visual artist whose projects have included a giant slide in Bristol and a huge replica of the moon – now he takes on the medieval bridge at the heart of Llangollen.  

Composer Paul Mealor has been working with the writer Mererid Hopwood on a piece for orchestra and chorus on the theme of tangefedd (peace). It’s a work that reflects the original spirit of the Eisteddfod, which was set up to unite nations through music and dance following the Second World War. More than 100 socially distanced singers take part, drawn from several of the choirs that have won at Llangollen in the past.

It was during this era in the early 1960s that they created a string of pop hits such as Take Good Care of My Baby for Bobby Vee, The Locomotion for Little Eva and Will You Love Me Tomorrow for the Shirelles, which became the first number one hit by a black American girl group. They also wrote the era-defining Up on the Roof for the Drifters and the magnificent Natural Woman for Aretha Franklin.

By 1970 Carole was divorced from songwriting partner Gerry Goffin and had moved to Los Angeles. It was here that she created her classic solo album Tapestry, packed with delightful tunes but also, for the first time, her own lyrics, very much sung from the heart. The album included It's Too Late, I Feel the Earth Move and You've Got a Friend and held the record for the most weeks at number one by a solo female artist for nearly 20 years. It became a trusted part of everyone's record collection and has sold over 25 million copies to date.

The film features some wonderful unseen material and home movies, and narrates her life as an acclaimed singer-songwriter. To date, more than 400 of her compositions have been recorded by over 1,000 artists, resulting in 100 hit singles.

More recently, in 2013, Carole was the first woman to be awarded the prestigious Gershwin Prize for Popular Song by the Library of Congress for her songwriting, whilst in 2014 Broadway production Beautiful, which tells her life story during the Goffin and King era, has received rave reviews. And in 2015, Carole was a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors, celebrating her lifetime artistic achievements.

Her infamous Strange Fruit, the first protest song of the civil rights movement, earned her powerful enemies. She was also an enigma, her telling of her own life story a mix of half truths and free-form improvisations.

Then, in the late 1960s journalist Linda Lipnack Kuehl set out to write the definitive biography of Billie. Over the next decade, she tracked down and tape-recorded interviews with the extraordinary characters that populated the iconic singer’s short, tumultuous life.

Raw, emotional and brutally honest, these incredible testimonies ranged from musical greats like Charles Mingus, Tony Bennett, Sylvia Syms and Count Basie to her cousin, schoolfriends, lovers, lawyers, pimps and even the FBI agents who arrested her. But Linda’s book was never finished, and the tapes remained unplayed – until now.

With unprecedented and exclusive access to Linda's astonishing 200 hours of never-before-heard interviews, this documentary showcases an American legend, capturing her depths and complexity through the voices of those who knew her best.

Ever since its premiere in Turin in 1896, La bohème has been a huge hit with audiences across the world. Within two years, it had been seen in Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, Prague, Berlin, Manchester and beyond. With over 500 performances chalked up at Covent Garden alone, this opera is one of the most popular and enduring in the repertoire. 

In this performance from 2020, Sonya Yoncheva stars as the doomed seamstress Mimì, with Charles Castronovo as Rodolfo, who falls in love with her at first sight. Simona Mihai and Andrzej Filonczyk perform the roles of the on-off lovers, Musetta and Marcello. 

Richard Jones’s period production brings to life the garret flats and shopping arcades of 19th-century Paris, with designs by Stewart Laing, pitting the rags of the bohemians against the riches of the swanky shopping arcades and restaurants of the French capital.

Technology and digital media have revolutionised how we hear music. Digital platforms like YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music and others make music instantly available to everyone. Computers and the internet have changed how music is written and composed and, via social media, artists can communicate directly with their fans - they can even release their music to them with a single tweet.

Nile shows us how he has adapted to this new world and why he wants to be a part of it. We discover how, in recent years, he has collaborated with a more diverse range of musicians on a greater variety of music than ever before.

The first collaboration we hear about is Get Lucky with Daft Punk, which became a Grammy-award-winning international hit. Later, we have contributions from singer-songwriter Laura Mvula, who won a Novello award this year for her album The Dreaming Room which Nile worked on. We hear from top country music star Keith Urban - they were both nominated last year at the Country Music Awards. And from Swedish DJ and composer Avicii, who plays to audiences of tens of thousands around the world, we discover the closeness of their musical relationship and learn about their working methods. We discover how Nile's contribution to singer John Newman's song Give Me Your Love came about.

In what is the 40th anniversary of Nile's band Chic, we see him on stage in Glasgow, and at the end of the film Nile reveals that he has just finished recording a new song. Called I Believe In Music, this at present unreleased song sums up Nile's personal philosophy toward the art form that has dominated his life.

With unlimited access to Paloma as a woman, a mother and an international pop star, this film follows her on an emotional journey as she balances the demands of a vital make-or-break tour with writing a new album, launching an acting career and being a first-time mum. 

The film observes Paloma’s life both front and backstage in the midst of this pivotal year for her career. We see her struggling with choices every mum will be familiar with, whilst embarking on enormous career challenges in a cut-throat business. Paloma not only returns to work after having her baby, but also to huge expectations to break Australia and America.

A familiar presence on the London underground circuit for several years, Paloma Faith eventually broke into the mainstream thanks to her ultra-flamboyant theatrical style and retro-soul sound. Born in Hackney to a Spanish father and English mother, at the age of 18 she made her debut on the cabaret scene, singing in a covers band called Paloma and the Penetrators, before performing as a magician’s assistant and appearing in a burlesque troupe. After turning down an opportunity to join Amy Winehouse’s band, she began writing and performing her own songs, and soon earned a reputation as one of London’s most exciting and flamboyant live acts.
 
She hit the big time in 2009 after releasing her first album, which reached number two in the UK and went platinum within weeks of release. Since then, she has sold well over a million records, with three more albums released, each of which went double platinum and reached number one in the album charts. She is a household name in Britain, having been a judge on The Voice and having had roles in numerous television series and films. Now, after returning to work following the birth, she will star as the villain in a new Batman TV series, write and launch her fifth album, and, she hopes, crack America – all while being a working mum.

The film sees Paloma pitted against a music industry that does not always look to kindly on motherhood, and with Paloma’s unrelenting ambition, the question the film asks is 'Can a woman have it all?' In seeing Paloma’s attempts to achieve this very goal, the film raises fundamental questions about women today and the sacrifices they have to make.";Music;BBC TWO;Contains some strong language.;2021;59;music, signed;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09bp1fb.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09bp1fb.jpg;paloma faith sold well million album number one world headlined glastonbury sung ten thousand every week taken toughest challenge yet baby unlimited access paloma woman mother international pop star film follows emotional journey balance demand vital makeorbreak tour writing new album launching acting career firsttime mum film observes paloma ’ life front backstage midst pivotal year career see struggling choice every mum familiar whilst embarking enormous career challenge cutthroat business paloma return work baby also huge expectation break australia america familiar presence london underground circuit several year paloma faith eventually broke mainstream thanks ultraflamboyant theatrical style retrosoul sound born hackney spanish father english mother age 18 made debut cabaret scene singing cover band called paloma penetrator performing magician ’ assistant appearing burlesque troupe turning opportunity join amy winehouse ’ band began writing performing song soon earned reputation one london ’ exciting flamboyant live act hit big time 2009 releasing first album reached number two uk went platinum within week release since sold well million record three album released went double platinum reached number one album chart household name britain judge voice role numerous television series film returning work following birth star villain new batman tv series write launch fifth album hope crack america – working mum film see paloma pitted music industry always look kindly motherhood paloma ’ unrelenting ambition question film asks woman seeing paloma ’ attempt achieve goal film raise fundamental question woman today sacrifice make;1

Their mission: to raise the consciousness of a generation. With a rebellious attitude to match their militant image they sold millions of records preaching pro-black politics to fans of all races, all done through a groundbreaking wall of noise that changed the sound of hip hop. White, middle Americans were outraged, but their kids loved it. 

Not surprisingly, this confrontational approach attracted controversy. Critics claimed the group themselves were racist, exposing racial divides rather than promoting equality. They were banned from some TV and radio stations and when one member reportedly made anti-Semitic remarks in a newspaper interview the resulting media-storm threatened to end their career. Tensions were running high and arguments within the band ended in violence. Could they keep it together long enough to get their message across?

In the Royal Blackburn Hospital and the surrounding town, Gareth comes across a wealth of amateur musical talent. Working with them to devise and rehearse musical performances that reflect their experiences over the last year, he uncovers a range of moving stories about how the town has pulled together through the pandemic. 

In the hospital, Gareth meets porter Stephen. Before the pandemic, Stephen worked as a singer, but when all of the music venues in the area closed because of lockdown, he found himself in need of work and decided to take a job at the hospital. As a cleaner and porter during the height of the pandemic, Stephen found he was able to bring comfort to patients through his singing. Even now, with music venues open again, Stephen continues to work at the hospital, and the performance he devises with Gareth will beam his talent out across the town. 

Then there’s Tanviha, a local mother who found herself in critical care at the hospital when she contracted Covid-19 last year. At eight months pregnant, she had to give birth by caesarean before being put into an induced coma. Through the care of the hospital staff, Tanviha pulled through and was able to be reunited with her husband Tabraiz, baby son Kameel and her three-year-old daughter Sonum. Her moving and uplifting story will culminate in a family song at the concert.

Other performers include local pub landlady, Carole, who helps Gareth lead a special singalong in the town square, teenagers Ray and Maddison, who’ve helped to compose an original song, and ambulance driver Justin, whose powerful voice leads a new interpretation of Good King Wenceslas.

The final concert is an emotional thank you to the local hospital, an uplifting celebration of community and a chance to bring some festive joy to the nation.";Documentary;BBC TWO;False;2021;59;music, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0bbnvz2.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0bbnvz2.jpg;seasonal special choirmaster gareth malone head blackburn one area country hardest hit covid19 create concert celebrates work nh staff community spirit town royal blackburn hospital surrounding town gareth come across wealth amateur musical talent working devise rehearse musical performance reflect experience last year uncovers range moving story town pulled together pandemic hospital gareth meet porter stephen pandemic stephen worked singer music venue area closed lockdown found need work decided take job hospital cleaner porter height pandemic stephen found able bring comfort patient singing even music venue open stephen continues work hospital performance devise gareth beam talent across town ’ tanviha local mother found critical care hospital contracted covid19 last year eight month pregnant give birth caesarean put induced coma care hospital staff tanviha pulled able reunited husband tabraiz baby son kameel threeyearold daughter sonum moving uplifting story culminate family song concert performer include local pub landlady carole help gareth lead special singalong town square teenager ray maddison ’ helped compose original song ambulance driver justin whose powerful voice lead new interpretation good king wenceslas final concert emotional thank local hospital uplifting celebration community chance bring festive joy nation;1

He is intent on making a success of his music career, but that’s not straightforward.;"Twenty-year-old Digga D is one of the biggest up-and-coming drill artists in the UK. He’s on the brink of stardom, with his singles getting millions of views online. But he has also been jailed for violent disorder. This film follows him as he is released from a 15-month stint in prison, at a pivotal moment in his life. He is intent on making a success of his music career, but that’s not straightforward.

Digga D is one of the first musicians in British history to be given a criminal behaviour order that controls his creative output. It means he is not allowed to release any music, or videos, without telling the police. If the music breaches the terms of his CBO – for example 'inciting or encouraging violence', they can take it down and arrest him.

The police say they target drill because it promotes and causes violence, but the genre’s supporters call this censorship and say that the art simply reflects real life. Digga’s situation, and his ongoing story, embodies this dilemma. His next moves could redefine his life, and his music, forever. A year after his social media accounts stopped, a year after his last music video, his last post and his last tweet, Digga is coming back. This film tells the story of how he manages that, and who is helping him. His lawyer Cecilia has been defending him for years. She is doing all she can to enable him to make music, despite his restrictions. But with his music so rigorously policed, can he do that and secure his future?

Don and Phil Everly's love of music began as children, encouraged by their father Ike. Little Donnie and Baby Boy Phil sang on Ike's early morning radio shows in Iowa.

After leaving school, the brothers moved to Nashville where, under the wing of Ike Everly's friend, the highly talented musician Chet Atkins, Don and Phil signed with Cadence Records. They exploded onto the music scene in 1957 with Bye Bye Love, written by Boudleaux and Felice Bryant.

After Bye Bye Love came other hits, notably Wake Up Little Susie, followed by the worldwide smash hit All I Have to Do Is Dream and a long string of other great songs which also became hits.

200;200;Fake or Fortune?;Series 9: 4. A King’s Last Supper;Could a picture bought online for £50 be a missing 18th-century work by Benjamin West?;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p09py56p.jpg;BBC, iPlayer, TV, Fake or Fortune?, Series 9: 4. A King’s Last Supper;Could a picture bought online for £50 be a missing 18th-century work by Benjamin West?;Anglesey farmer Huw Lewis bought a small painting depicting the Last Supper for £50 on the internet. Can the team prove it’s an eighteenth-century work by the artist Benjamin West?;"The team head to the beautiful island of Anglesey at the northernmost tip of Wales, where Huw Lewis has a sheep farm. Huw  frequently spends his evenings scouring the internet for art bargains and was trawling through eBay when he came across a small, unattributed oil sketch of Jesus and the apostles at the Last Supper. He immediately sensed it was something special and was amazed when nobody bid against him. He secured it for just £50. He later learned that it had been in the seller’s family for decades, and they had assumed it to be practically worthless. 

After doing some online research of his own, Huw thought he might have identified the artist as Benjamin West. Born in Pennsylvania, West left America in his twenties and settled in Britain, where he quickly found fame and fortune. By the late eighteenth century, he was one of the most celebrated artists of the day, renowned for the bold storytelling of his history paintings. Perhaps his biggest fan was King George III, who made West his official history painter. Together they aimed to bring about a magnificent new era in British art.   

Huw’s picture is an unusual one, as it is a small canvas that appears to be semi-finished. It’s partly painted in oils, but also visible are bold, black lines delineating the figures. After examining the picture closely, Philip is intrigued by it but is also worried by its condition. It appears to have been scrubbed in places, and layers of dirt have built up over the years. There’s also no signature, which, given West was very good at promoting himself and his work, is concerning. But Fiona discovers that Benjamin West was commissioned by King George III to paint two paintings of the Last Supper for chapels at Windsor Castle, and at the Royal Academy of Arts she discovers that one of the preparatory sketches for those paintings hasn’t been seen for a century. Could it be that Huw’s internet bargain is the missing West sketch? 

Forensic science will be key, as a genuine eighteenth-century picture could reveal some more unusual ingredients, and West was known to experiment with paints. At her laboratory in the Courtauld Institute of Art, Professor Aviva Burnstock examines the picture and reveals some surprising details that the naked eye would never see. 

But this proves to be one of the team’s most difficult investigations. As well as the worrying condition of the picture, they face a provenance trail that should stretch back more than two hundred years. There’s also the added challenge of doing research in the midst of lockdown. With the odds so stacked against them, can they prove that Huw’s internet bargain is actually a long-lost work fit for a king?";Documentary;BBC ONE;False;2021;59;arts, signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09py56p.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09py56p.jpg;team head beautiful island anglesey northernmost tip wale huw lewis sheep farm huw frequently spends evening scouring internet art bargain trawling ebay came across small unattributed oil sketch jesus apostle last supper immediately sensed something special amazed nobody bid secured £50 later learned seller ’ family decade assumed practically worthless online research huw thought might identified artist benjamin west born pennsylvania west left america twenty settled britain quickly found fame fortune late eighteenth century one celebrated artist day renowned bold storytelling history painting perhaps biggest fan king george iii made west official history painter together aimed bring magnificent new era british art huw ’ picture unusual one small canvas appears semifinished ’ partly painted oil also visible bold black line delineating figure examining picture closely philip intrigued also worried condition appears scrubbed place layer dirt built year ’ also signature given west good promoting work concerning fiona discovers benjamin west commissioned king george iii paint two painting last supper chapel windsor castle royal academy art discovers one preparatory sketch painting ’ seen century could huw ’ internet bargain missing west sketch forensic science key genuine eighteenthcentury picture could reveal unusual ingredient west known experiment paint laboratory courtauld institute art professor aviva burnstock examines picture reveals surprising detail naked eye would never see prof one team ’ difficult investigation well worrying condition picture face provenance trail stretch back two hundred year ’ also added challenge research midst lockdown odds stacked prove huw ’ internet bargain actually longlost work fit king;9

Film-maker Lisa Immordino Vreeland brings these two forces together in a unique and fascinating head-to-head, comparing and contrasting their trajectories through duelling voices – the writers’ own, culled from archival footage, and those of actors Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto, who portray Capote and Williams at various stages of their lives. 

Both writers constructed rich, imaginary worlds and characters - Blanche DuBois and Holly Golightly to mention just two - which left indelible marks on the era. Both men also paid the price of colossal success and fame, suffering alcoholism and periods of artistic stagnation.

Aoife’s first memory of the Brontës is as a child when she watched her father, the actor Ciaran Hinds, play Mr Rochester, one of the most iconic figures in literature. In a journey which takes Aoife from County Down to St John’s College, Cambridge, she discovers how the father of the Brontës, Patrick, rose from humble beginnings in Rathfriland to become curate of Haworth parsonage. Then, unusually for the time, he encouraged and supported his daughters’ desire to be educated and to write.      
 
Aoife discovers the impact a second Irish man had on the Brontë story. Arthur Bell Nicholls, from Killead, Co. Antrim, courted Charlotte for many years before she finally agreed to marry him. The newlyweds honeymooned in Ireland, and Aoife visits the archives of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, where she reads one of the letters Charlotte wrote while in Ireland.

Yet an unwillingness to talk to the press and a withdrawal from public life in the mid 1980s mean that many have not understood how influential he was and remains.

Although their conversation covers much about the author's influences and ambitions - with the notable exception of any mention of his time as a spy - much of the interview looks at the modern phenomenon of the secret service agent as a hero.

In a revealing insight, le Carre explains that his dislike of James Bond stems from the fact that Bond doesn't exist in a political context, making him more of an ""international gangster"" than a spy. Although Malcolm Muggeridge talks about his own, very brief, period of spying, John le Carre remains close-lipped about his (much more extensive) career in espionage. Le Carre (real name David Cornwell) began working for MI5 in 1952 and transferred to MI6 in 1960.

Bridget Riley has been challenging our perception through painting for over 60 years, with radical work that has transformed how we look at art and invites us to feel with our eyes.
 
With simple black and white geometric shapes, repeated curves of colour or an array of muted dots, Riley’s work moves, shimmers and - in some cases - unsettles.
 
At the age of 90, Bridget Riley shows no signs of stopping. Her paintings command millions at auction, she has won prestigious awards and honours, and continues to innovate, paint, publish and exhibit around the world.
 
BBC cameras have filmed with Riley over the past few years in two of her studios, on the cliffs of Cornwall, where she spent the Second World War, and at the National Gallery in London during the installation of her enormous mural there in 2018.
 
In a rare and revealing interview with Kirsty Wark, Riley dispels the numerous misconceptions which have followed her throughout her career. Many consider her as a poster girl for the Swinging 60s, while others hail her as a titan of abstract art. However, Riley considers herself a traditional painter who has merely picked up the baton from those who have gone before her, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Monet, Cezanne and Matisse.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains flashing images.;2021;59;arts, signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0b2x4tm.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0b2x4tm.jpg;exclusive behindthescenes access seldomseen footage archive insight admirer expert contemporary including tracey emin michael craigmartin martin freeman revealing interview kirsty wark story true visionary british art bridget riley challenging perception painting 60 year radical work transformed look art invite u feel eye simple black white geometric shape repeated curve colour array muted dot riley ’ work move shimmer case unsettles age 90 bridget riley show sign stopping painting command million auction prestigious award honour continues innovate paint publish exhibit around world bbc camera filmed riley past year two studio cliff cornwall spent second world war national gallery london installation enormous mural 2018 rare revealing interview kirsty wark riley dispels numerous misconception followed throughout career many consider poster girl swinging 60 others hail titan abstract art however riley considers traditional painter merely picked baton gone leonardo da vinci monet cezanne matisse;9

The film begins in the first decades of the 20th century, an era of human self-confidence, intent on conquering nature. In the art of Piet Mondrian, James explores how an artist who began life as a landscape painter gradually leaves nature behind, tidying up the messy reality of nature into abstract lines. We meet Chinese artist Yang Yongliang on the streets of New York, whose sprawling digital landscapes ask questions about our drive for rapid urbanisation.

James continues to explore this story through the images of one of the best photographers of the last century – and one of its most brilliant women - Margaret Bourke-White. In 1930, she was the first professional western photographer to be allowed into the Soviet Union, where she captured the rapid transformation of the country from being largely rural into a modern, industrial state. James moves on to explore how the destructive power of the atomic age both terrified and inspired artists in the 1940s and 1950s, from painters like Bittinger to the world of sci-fi films.

We then see the arrival of a new kind of art – land art. In the late 60s and 70s, a growing number of artists left the city and started working not only in nature but with it. We meet two contemporary land artists based in New Zealand: Philippa Jones and Martin Hill, who use natural materials to create sculptures in the landscapes of New Zealand’s South Island. And finally, we explore how artist collective Random International are using technology to explore our future relationship with nature – through a series of mesmerising art works.

James finishes the episode and the series asking questions of the interviewees who have appeared across the series. How do they see our future relationship with nature?

He concludes that on the long journey we humans have been on since our beginnings, artists have played a vital role not only in reflecting but also shaping our attitudes to nature. They’ve helped us understand its intricacy, appreciate its beauty, and now – when the entire planet seems under threat – they can help us forge a new relationship with it.";Documentary;BBC FOUR;False;2021;59;arts, signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09xt337.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09xt337.jpg;concluding episode series james explores art last hundred year reflects swapped nature progress first half 20th century rediscovering beauty decade following second world war today ’ artist reimagining future relationship nature film begin first decade 20th century era human selfconfidence intent conquering nature art piet mondrian james explores artist began life landscape painter gradually leaf nature behind tidying messy reality nature abstract line meet chinese artist yang yongliang street new york whose sprawling digital landscape ask question drive rapid urbanisation james continues explore story image one best photographer last century – one brilliant woman margaret bourkewhite 1930 first professional western photographer allowed soviet union captured rapid transformation country largely rural modern industrial state james move explore destructive power atomic age terrified inspired artist 1940s 1950s painter like bittinger world scifi film see arrival new kind art – land art late 60 70 growing number artist left city started working nature meet two contemporary land artist based new zealand philippa jones martin hill use natural material create sculpture landscape new zealand ’ south island finally explore artist collective random international using technology explore future relationship nature – series mesmerising art work james finish episode series asking question interviewee appeared across series see future relationship nature concludes long journey human since beginning artist played vital role reflecting also shaping attitude nature ’ helped u understand intricacy appreciate beauty – entire planet seems threat – help u forge new relationship;9

The Vital Spark;Simon Schama explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world.;Documentary. Simon Schama explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world, looking at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity.;"Simon Schama begins Civilisations with this premise: that it is in art - the play of the creative imagination - that humanity expresses its most essential self: the power to break the tyranny of the humdrum, the grind of everyday. Art makes life worth living and is the great window into human potential. And societies become civilised to the extent that they take culture as seriously as the prosecution of power or the accumulation of wealth. But in the century of total war and industrial slaughter, was (and is) that enough? 

The cause of humanity went up in the smoke of the Nazi crematoria. Horror and terror brushed beauty aside and stamped on its pretensions. In the modern world, art has become increasingly commodified. Simon's last programme explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world. It looks at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity and turns on one central question. Should art create a realm separate from the modern world, a place where we can escape and pull the ladder up after us? Or should it plunge headlong into the chaos and cacophony while transforming the way we see it and live in it?

Using the works of both dead and contemporary artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, Simon seeks answers to these profound questions. His conclusion is imbued with hope: despite all the travails of the present, by engaging with the here-and-now, art still offers civilisation an insight into the incomprehensibility of the world and a way to transcend its horrors with the enduring creativity of the human spirit.";History;BBC TWO;Contains adult themes.;2018;59;arts, signed, history, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p07jx3bd.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07jx3bd.jpg;simon schama begin civilisation premise art play creative imagination humanity express essential self power break tyranny humdrum grind everyday art make life worth living great window human potential society become civilised extent take culture seriously prosecution power accumulation wealth century total war industrial slaughter enough cause humanity went smoke nazi crematorium horror terror brushed beauty aside stamped pretension modern world art become increasingly commodified simon last programme explores fate art machine profitdriven world look rise art tradeable commodity turn one central question art create realm separate modern world place escape pull ladder u plunge headlong chaos cacophony transforming way see live using work dead contemporary artist 20th 21st century simon seek answer profound question conclusion imbued hope despite travail present engaging hereandnow art still offer civilisation insight incomprehensibility world way transcend horror enduring creativity human spirit;9

In Snowdonia, he learns how Augustus John and JD Innes led the way, obsessively painting the landscape with a freedom and vibrancy that still dazzles today. Equally bold was the work of Gwen John, whose work is in complete contrast to that of her brother Augustus. At the National Museum Wales in Cardiff, Huw discovers how she used light and tone to paint delicate and hypnotic portraits and interior scenes.

Between the wars, industrial south Wales produced some of the most powerful art of the century. Huw discovers how the work of Evan Walters and Cedric Morris is steeped in their experience of mining communities and the desperate poverty they endured. The lives of striking miners were rarely reflected in art, but Walters’s 1926 portrait of his friend William Hopkins captured his subject with dignity and honesty.

Travelling north, Huw heads out to Bardsey Island off the Llyn Peninsula, a place he first visited as a teenager. The landscape of Wales has long been a source of inspiration for artists and in the 1940s Brenda Chamberlain moved to Bardsey to immerse herself in its isolation. Inside the picturesque cottage where she lived, Huw sees her sketches of island life that she drew on the walls ‘as if they were a giant sketchbook’. At the same time, Kyffin Williams was painting the distinctive, dramatic landscapes of north Wales, establishing himself as the most popular Welsh artist of the 20th century. 

Contemporary art in Wales reflects a post-devolution self-confidence that allows it to look both back and forward. In Swansea, Huw meets Daniel Trivedy and learns how his award-winning work Welsh Emergency Blanket took the patterns of traditional Welsh blankets and printed them on to the silver foil coverings given to refugees rescued from the sea. For his final stop, Huw visits Colwyn Bay where he meets internationally renowned artist Bedwyr Williams, whose work draws heavily on Welsh art history using humour and irreverence.

Mark's father, Stan, made sculptures that stand to this day on the streets of Glenrothes, East Kilbride and the Scottish new town that never was, Stonehouse. These new towns employed town artists to make artworks in the very housing precincts the new residents were moving into.

Stan Bonnar was the first assistant to seminal town artist David Harding in Glenrothes in the early 70s, then became town artist himself at East Kilbride and Stonehouse Development Corporation later on in the decade. His first new town artwork was the concrete hippos that have stalked Glenrothes for almost 50 years.

Scotland’s new town artists were at the forefront of a shift in thinking that changed the relationship between art and public places. Rather than plinths and bronze likenesses of dead soldiers and politicians, this art would be found in playgrounds,  on underpasses, by bus stops, and could be seen out of people’s living room windows. The environment and surroundings of the work were seen as part of the art itself, the context in which the sculptures stand being part of what they have to say. The new town art was there for everyone, designed to define the places it was made and to mean something to the people who lived alongside it.

Mark uncovers the relationship between the new towns and their art, tracing a legacy of the approach taken by the development corporations and revealing the impact of the town artists’ work in the communities they were made for. Across Scotland, from Irvine in the west, via East Kilbride, Cumbernauld, Livingston and Glenrothes, Mark travels to talk with former town artists such as David Harding, Malcolm Robertson, Mary Bourne and Denis Barns, and to learn about Brian Miller. On his travels, he finds out how some work has survived, some has been damaged and some lost. This journey takes Mark closer to an understanding of his father’s approach to art and helps him grasp the context and legacy of the towns, the artists and their work.";Documentary;BBC SCOTLAND;Contains some strong language.;2021;58;arts, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0b716g8.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0b716g8.jpg;actor mark bonnar mission understand scottish new town grew exploring street sculpture made artist dad 60 70 80 discovers new town enticed people bigger city uncovers surprising way public art changed new town new town changed public art mark father stan made sculpture stand day street glenrothes east kilbride scottish new town never stonehouse new town employed town artist make artwork housing precinct new resident moving stan bonnar first assistant seminal town artist david harding glenrothes early 70 became town artist east kilbride stonehouse development corporation later decade first new town artwork concrete hippo stalked glenrothes almost 50 year scotland ’ new town artist forefront shift thinking changed relationship art public place rather plinth bronze likeness dead soldier politician art would found playground underpass bus stop could seen people ’ living room window environment surroundings work seen part art context sculpture stand part say new town art everyone designed define place made mean something people lived alongside mark uncovers relationship new town art tracing legacy approach taken development corporation revealing impact town artist ’ work community made across scotland irvine west via east kilbride cumbernauld livingston glenrothes mark travel talk former town artist david harding malcolm robertson mary bourne denis barn learn brian miller travel find work survived damaged lost journey take mark closer understanding father ’ approach art help grasp context legacy town artist work;9

Glasgow;Technical problems frustrate Bendor and Emma’s investigation of a 300-year-old portrait.;Technical difficulties frustrate Bendor’s attempt to uncover who painted an unfinished portrait in a Glasgow museum. Emma reveals the true identity of the sitter after 300 years.;"Britain’s premier art detectives, Bendor Grosvenor and Emma Dabiri, are on the hunt to find and restore one of the nation’s great lost masterpieces. Can a mysterious painting of a beautiful society woman really be by the celebrated artist Joshua Reynolds? And which celebrity playwright will lead them from Rome to Bath to London’s Royal Academy? With a fascinating treasure hunt into the art of the Georgians and a very modern 21st-century digital restoration, the results are truly spectacular.  

Bendor traces the remarkable life of Sir Joshua from humble beginnings in the West Country to reach the pinnacle of the artistic establishment, becoming the first president of the Royal Academy and the country's most respected authority on art. In Rome, Bendor explores how Reynolds developed his style, known as the Grand Manner, and visiting the home of a private collector, he looks at a little-known self-portrait by Reynolds. Bendor explains why he believes it to be the greatest self-portrait ever made by a British artist, with virtuoso brushwork and a fluidity that gives it a remarkably modern appeal. Intensely personal and sympathetic, it was painted when Reynolds was at the height of his success, wealthy enough to buy a large house in the centre of London, lavishly furnished and adapted for his own needs. Bendor is also pleased to see the picture has many similarities to the portrait of Elizabeth Linley. 

Emma explores the story of the man who donated the picture, Archibald McLellan, a wealthy businessman whose passion for art saw him amass an outstanding collection, which he left to the city of Glasgow. 

Reynolds's achievements culminated with his presidency of the newly created Royal Academy of the Arts, a position he made his own and which gave him an authority to promote his own opinions about painting. The suite of rooms at Somerset House in the Strand, where the academy was originally housed, have recently been restored. Bendor visits it to get a taste of the spaces that would have been familiar to Reynolds, including the Great Room, where the tradition of the Summer Exhibition was born under Sir Joshua. 

At the restoration studio, the portrait itself has been subject to close scrutiny. At some point in the last few years, the surface of the painting had been coated with a thick varnish, which has now discoloured and darkened. However, Reynolds's unorthodox painting methods, often using wax instead of oil to mix his paints, mean it must undergo stringent technical analysis to ensure it is safe to clean it. It soon becomes clear it will be impossible to restore the picture, which Bendor feels will damage the prospects of a favourable verdict from the Reynolds expert, Martin Postle. 

Emma investigates the brief and tragic life of the woman who has always been the accepted subject of the picture, Elizabeth Linley. A child prodigy, she became a celebrity singer performing in her hometown of Bath from the age of nine. In her teens, she was regarded as a great beauty and suffered frequent but unwelcome attention from suitors. She eloped and married the playwright and politician Richard Brindsley Sheridan, and found herself at the centre of a constitutional crisis before her tragic early death at the age of 37. Emma is puzzled to know what evidence there is that the portrait is really Elizabeth, as there have been doubts expressed in the past. When she looks at some of Reynolds's vivid and insightful portraits of female celebrities from the Georgian era, she is surprised when she uncovers the true identity of the sitter in our portrait. 

To give a sense of how the portrait would look if it had been possible to clean it, and to give his case a boost, Bendor creates a three-dimensional digital facsimile using laser scanning techniques and high-resolution re-colourisation. The portrait is returned to Glasgow for the verdict to be revealed.";Documentary;BBC FOUR;False;2022;59;arts, signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0bm1qx6.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0bm1qx6.jpg;britain ’ premier art detective bendor grosvenor emma dabiri hunt find restore one nation ’ great lost masterpiece mysterious painting beautiful society woman really celebrated artist joshua reynolds celebrity playwright lead rome bath london ’ royal academy fascinating treasure hunt art georgian modern 21stcentury digital restoration result truly spectacular bendor trace remarkable life sir joshua humble beginning west country reach pinnacle artistic establishment becoming first president royal academy country respected authority art rome bendor explores reynolds developed style known grand manner visiting home private collector look littleknown selfportrait reynolds bendor explains belief greatest selfportrait ever made british artist virtuoso brushwork fluidity give remarkably modern appeal intensely personal sympathetic painted reynolds height success wealthy enough buy large house centre london lavishly furnished adapted need bendor also pleased see picture many similarity portrait elizabeth linley emma explores story man donated picture archibald mclellan wealthy businessman whose passion art saw amass outstanding collection left city glasgow reynolds achievement culminated presidency newly created royal academy art position made gave authority promote opinion painting suite room somerset house strand academy originally housed recently restored bendor visit get taste space would familiar reynolds including great room tradition summer exhibition born sir joshua restoration studio portrait subject close scrutiny point last year surface painting coated thick varnish discoloured darkened however reynolds unorthodox painting method often using wax instead oil mix paint mean must undergo stringent technical analysis ensure safe clean soon becomes clear impossible restore picture bendor feel damage prospect favourable verdict reynolds expert martin postle emma investigates brief tragic life woman always accepted subject picture elizabeth linley child prodigy became celebrity singer performing hometown bath age nine teen regarded great beauty suffered frequent unwelcome attention suitor eloped married playwright politician richard brindsley sheridan found centre constitutional crisis tragic early death age 37 emma puzzled know evidence portrait really elizabeth doubt expressed past look reynolds vivid insightful portrait female celebrity georgian era surprised uncovers true identity sitter portrait give sense portrait would look possible clean give case boost bendor creates threedimensional digital facsimile using laser scanning technique highresolution recolourisation portrait returned glasgow verdict revealed;9

It’s this unlikely relationship that provides the inspiration for Afrofuturism, the broad cultural trend that encompasses works by Jean-Michel Basquiat to Grace Jones, Solange Knowles and Sun Ra. In this film, we meet, see and hear from artists across three continents who each, in their own way, explore the Afrofuture to look at the horrors of the black past and imagine alternative futures.

The mysterious yet influential Detroit techno duo, Drexciya, take the Atlantic Ocean, a site of death and destruction during the African slave trade and reclaim it as a place of creation and beauty. Through a series of releases from the late 1990s through the early 2000s, they envisage the unborn children of enslaved pregnant women, thrown overboard during the Middle Passage to the Americas, adapting to breathe under water and thrive in a Black Atlantis. The mythos is vividly brought to life by the Drexciyan collaborator and graphic artist Abdul Qadim Haqq as a thriving, technological undersea world.

Visual artist Ellen Gallagher similarly transforms the violence of the ocean into rebirth and renewal. Her film Osedax, made with Edgar Cleijne, is an imaginative retelling of how the skeletal remains of dead whales sustain new life in the curious form of the bone-devouring worm of the title. Whereas for artist Hew Locke, as well as the ocean itself, it’s the Atlantic’s coastal fringes that inspire his world of bricolage phantoms, plucked from the ghost stories of a Guyanese childhood. 

The Afrofuture is perhaps most commonly imagined through the rubric of outer space, thanks in no small part to avant-garde jazz musician and poet Sun Ra.  Born in the southern US in the early 20th century, Ra underwent an interplanetary conversion, claiming to have been teleported to Saturn. As with funk pioneer, George Clinton, who describes a similar close encounter with extraterrestrials, Ra’s identification with an alien presence can be read as more than simple escapism. It’s also a biting satire on the alienating experience of being black in America. For Ra, space is also an alternate destiny for black people, as the title of his 1973 Afrofuturist feature film Space is the Place insists. 

Reaching beyond these fictional ‘Afronauts’ is the conceptual artist Tavares Strachan. His performance piece, Star City, Training in Six Parts, sees Strachan visit the famous Russian space centre to undergo the same rigorous – and often tortuous – training of the Cosmonauts. Strachan likens one of the exercises, which measures our capacity to withstand disorientation and gravitational stress, to his impoverished upbringing in The Bahamas. 

The film concludes with an exploration of the idea of double consciousness. Coined in the early 20th century by WEB Du Bois, the influential African American sociologist, double-consciousness describes how black people in western societies see themselves twice over. Through their lived experience but also how they’re perceived within a dominant white culture.

Curator and writer Ekow Eshun traces uses of the idea through Ralph Ellison’s lauded mid-20th-century novel Invisible Man, and painter Kerry James Marshall’s image of the same title, right up to the Black Lives Matter movement. Predicated upon recordings of anti-black violence often captured through digital tech, Eshun argues these ‘expose’ a double consciousness at work, the world as experienced and seen through black eyes, laid bare for all to witness.

277;277;Salt, by Selina Thompson;None;Artist Selina Thompson recalls her journey by sea to retrace a route of the slave trade.;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p09z0lh3.jpg;BBC, iPlayer, TV, Salt, by Selina Thompson;Artist Selina Thompson recalls her journey by sea to retrace a route of the slave trade.;Performance artist Selina Thompson recreates her award-winning and deeply personal monologue about her journey by cargo ship, retracing the route of the transatlantic slave trade.;"Performance artist Selina Thompson recreates her award-winning dramatic monologue about a journey she made by cargo ship to retrace the triangular route of the transatlantic slave trade. Poetic and deeply personal, Salt is part testimony, part performance and part excavation of collective memory through archive and music.

Throughout the film, Thompson explores her painfully difficult but ultimately redemptive exploration of the Atlantic triangle, and in doing so, takes us on a cathartic pilgrimage through grief, race and identity. Darkly comic in places but also intensely sad, Salt is Thompson’s deeply human response to being both British and a descendant of a people enslaved by the British.

Central to Salt is Thompson’s physical performance of her monologue. She plays a character, known simply as The Woman, who pounds great rocks of salt, tells profound stories and makes wry observations. The Woman allows Thompson’s particular journey and personal experience to hold a greater resonance, representing the afterlife of slavery and colonialism. 

The salt the Woman breaks down into manageable pieces embodies that shared experience – the labour of negotiating racism, the tears, the sweat, the healing. The salt is also of the sea, itself a character in the piece that plays witness to the atrocities of the Middle Passage.

Complementing Thompson’s performance is a revealing, unflinchingly honest and at times humorous interview conducted by Afua Hirsch.

Thompson describes her journey, reflecting on the feelings and thoughts that defined her experience at the time, as well as her meditations now, five years after the original journey. She is an exceptional storyteller and her candidness, vivid powers of description and facility with language give Salt a raw and powerful intimacy. 

Recalled in distinct chapters, Thompson’s journey takes her by sea from Belgium to Ghana, on to Jamaica and finally back across the Atlantic to Europe. She set out on this extraordinary journey not to try to experience the horror of the Middle Passage, but to ‘sit with it’, to commemorate the dead. Part way through her journey, that grieving process takes on an additional significance with the death of her beloved grandmother. 

In exploring the past and its lasting legacy, Thompson is also looking for new definitions of home on the three continents she visits, having been told variously her whole life that all of them and none of them were home. 

Footage of James Baldwin and Stuart Hall, who themselves grappled with this history and its afterlife, speaks to the inspiration and comfort Thompson drew from the black cultural archive and its distinct and rigorous legacy. 

In Europe, Selina’s place of birth, she examines what it means to be black in a country that must grapple with its leading role in, and lasting benefits from, both slavery and colonialism. Her first sea voyage, where she encounters toxic racism and the abuse of power, becomes a contemporary replica of empire. 

In Ghana, she explores the complexities of grief and remembrance, and what it means to commemorate a history and a people defined by absence. On her journey between Africa and the Caribbean, she confronts her own privilege and power, granted to her by her British passport.

In Jamaica, the country of her grandparents’ birth, she reflects on the nature of diasporic identity, on an island where most people’s ancestors came from somewhere else. On the final leg of her journey, overwhelmed by the weight of history and its ongoing legacy, she reaches a point of crisis, but ultimately, she does find home. Her long journey back into the past allows her, at last, to go forwards, as she closes with the quiet demand that we reckon with the past so that we can all do the same. 

Salt is a deeply moving account of a young woman grappling with the afterlife of slavery and colonialism. The artist in Thompson creates a performance that somehow makes the overwhelming and unsurmountable bearable for her. Steeped in anger but delivered with the lightest of touches, Salt in its essence is about love and family, whether those bonds are biological, chosen through adoption or simply the bonds inherent within the black community. In exposing her pain, and her path towards healing, Thompson lays bare a rare yet vital truth.";Arts;BBC FOUR;Contains language which may offend.;2021;46;arts;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09z0lh3.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09z0lh3.jpg;performance artist selina thompson recreates awardwinning dramatic monologue journey made cargo ship retrace triangular route transatlantic slave trade poetic deeply personal salt part testimony part performance part excavation collective memory archive music throughout film thompson explores painfully difficult ultimately redemptive exploration atlantic triangle take u cathartic pilgrimage grief race identity darkly comic place also intensely sad salt thompson ’ deeply human response british descendant people enslaved british central salt thompson ’ physical performance monologue play character known simply woman pound great rock salt tell profound story make wry observation woman allows thompson ’ particular journey personal experience hold greater resonance representing afterlife slavery colonialism salt woman break manageable piece embodies shared experience – labour negotiating racism tear sweat healing salt also sea character piece play witness atrocity middle passage complementing thompson ’ performance revealing unflinchingly honest time humorous interview conducted afua hirsch thompson describes journey reflecting feeling thought defined experience time well meditation five year original journey exceptional storyteller candidness vivid power description facility language give salt raw powerful intimacy recalled distinct chapter thompson ’ journey take sea belgium ghana jamaica finally back across atlantic europe set extraordinary journey try experience horror middle passage ‘ sit ’ commemorate dead part way journey grieving process take additional significance death beloved grandmother exploring past lasting legacy thompson also looking new definition home three continent visit told variously whole life none home footage james baldwin stuart hall grappled history afterlife speaks inspiration comfort thompson drew black cultural archive distinct rigorous legacy europe selina ’ place birth examines mean black country must grapple leading role lasting benefit slavery colonialism first sea voyage encounter toxic racism abuse power becomes contemporary replica empire ghana explores complexity grief remembrance mean commemorate history people defined absence journey africa caribbean confronts privilege power granted british passport jamaica country grandparent ’ birth reflects nature diasporic identity island people ’ ancestor came somewhere else final leg journey overwhelmed weight history ongoing legacy reach point crisis ultimately find home long journey back past allows last go forward close quiet demand reckon past salt deeply moving account young woman grappling afterlife slavery colonialism artist thompson creates performance somehow make overwhelming unsurmountable bearable steeped anger delivered lightest touch salt essence love family whether bond biological chosen adoption simply bond inherent within black community exposing pain path towards healing thompson lay bare rare yet vital truth;9

The Maasai are a semi-nomadic tribal group who inhabit much of Kenya and Tanzania. Many Maasai people continue to live traditional, pastoral lives. While the men tend to their cattle, Maasai women care for children, maintain the village buildings, and craft intricate, colourful beaded items. Necklaces, bracelets and headpieces are used in Maasai weddings and coming-of-age ceremonies, but they are also enormously popular with non-Maasai Kenyans and tourists. Over the past few decades, tourist interest in Maasai beads has allowed Maasai women to earn their own money for the first time.

Like many Maasai, Jane lives a modern life in Nairobi but retains a deep knowledge and reverence for her tribal heritage. The Maasai use beads to signify social and marital status. Colours also hold special importance, signifying elements of the Rift Valley landscape, as well as valued Maasai character traits such as bravery and friendship.

Almost everyone has good things to say about Turner - after all, he’s responsible for some of Britain’s greatest artistic treasures, like The Fighting Temeraire, and Rain, Steam and Speed. But exactly what makes him great is where opinions can differ.

Leslie discovers the TV art historians behind each theory. Was Turner great because he reinvented landscape painting, because he was a radical whose work marked the beginning of modern painting, or because he captured the extraordinary march of the industrial revolution? Through the archives, Leslie meets Fiona Bruce, Simon Schama, Andrew Graham-Dixon and Kenneth Clarke.

Leslie also finds that the disputed nature of Turner’s brilliance has made for some entertaining film-making, from a frock-coat- and powdered-wig-loaded reconstruction of his humble origins as the son of a barber in London’s Covent Garden, to modern art historian Tim Marlow lashing himself to a mast in the middle of a choppy ocean to recreate Turner’s inspiration for Fishermen at Sea.

Rare archive combines with performances from the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra.;"Scotland has always been intensely proud of its landscape. But at the same time, Scotland has always done its natural world grave harm. As the Cop26 conference on climate change approaches in Glasgow, BBC Scotland’s Changing Landscapes meditates upon the care and carelessness we’ve brought to bear on the environment.
 
In this 60-minute film, Scotland’s film and video archives from the last 100 years illustrate the story of this contradiction. The words of poets, ecologists, journalists and travellers - read by some of Scotland’s most famous voices - are combined with the voices of ordinary folk from our archival store; people whose relationship with land and nature is as varied as folk always are.
 
It is their workplace, the place where they take their leisure, the place where they go to shoot the carefully curated stocks of deer and grouse. We see how very deep we have mined and drilled in search of coal and oil – and how far we have hiked and biked in search of solitude and beauty. We learn that the damage done has always been at the back of our minds, at the very least since the 1930s.
 
Driving the film is BBC Scotland’s Scottish Symphony Orchestra performing a carefully selected soundtrack of work by Scottish composers old and new, featuring pieces by one of Scotland’s oldest living composers, Thea Musgrave, and one of its youngest, Jay Capperauld. We hear from some of the finest of Scotland’s folk musicians, Julie Fowlis and Kris Drever, who remind us that Scotland’s relationship with nature has been in many ways like a bad romance. 

Our narrators read passages from a wide range of sources. We hear words from Scotland’s newly appointed makar, Kathleen Jamie, and passages from poets such as Edwin Muir, Liz Lochhead, Edwin Morgan, Magi Gibson, Don Paterson and Robert Burns – evocations of Scotland’s landscapes, both rural and urban. We also hear from travel writers and journalists, old biographies of Osgood Mackenzie and excerpts of the ecologist Fraser Darling’s 1930s report on the Scottish Highlands: ‘they are a wet desert'.

His eyesight is fading fast, and he has one more painting to complete. From his studio just outside Montrose, Morrison can hear the crashing North Sea. On the wall is a drawing of Mickey Mouse that he completed when he was eight years old, at the outset of World War II.

‘My sight has deteriorated quite badly,’ Morrison admits. ‘And the very thought of coming in here and not being able to pick up a brush and do something with it really terrifies me.’ Nevertheless he has agreed to let film-maker Anthony Baxter follow him as he picks up the brushes again at the age of 85 after being sidelined by a series of operations. And while doing so, he reflects on an extraordinary artistic life.

Eye of the Storm is a fascinating exploration of what it means to be a landscape painter. It is also the poignant and universal story of a creative mind dealing with his own mortality, and the physical frailties that catch up with all of us. The film movingly intertwines Morrison’s struggle with old age, with his lively views as a much younger painter, captured in remarkable archive filmed more than 50 years ago. Pivotal moments in Morrison’s career are also brought vividly to life by Scottish animator Catriona Black. Indeed, her own journey to understand Morrison’s artistic genius, in order to do justice to it in the film, represents a story within a story in this multi-layered and visually stunning documentary.

As Morrison begins painting again, he is particularly troubled by the fact that – on doctor’s orders – he can’t paint outside. His lifelong compulsion to paint what he sees, en plein air, has taken him around the world – from Africa to Paris to Greenland.

Morrison explains that it all started in Glasgow. Son of a shipyard pipefitter, Morrison entered the famous Glasgow School of Art in 1950. While other students embraced the overtly political and abstract art then fashionable, Morrison was attracted to the landscape painters of a different era such as Claude Lorrain, Jean-François Millet and Scotland’s own Horatio McCulloch.

Morrison’s first major subjects were the crumbling Glasgow tenements, home to thousands of working-class families soon to be relocated to the outskirts of the city. Though painted without people, Morrison’s haunting paintings are memorials to a lost way of life, and would find their place in major museums. And his concern with documenting fleeting, disappearing worlds would become a recurring feature of his work.

Morrison’s work then underwent a dramatic shift when he moved to the tiny fishing village Catterline in north east Scotland in 1959. Here, Morrison effectively established what would become a famed artists’ colony, along with painter Joan Eardley. As he views archive from the time, which he has not seen in half a century, Morrison relives his artistic and personal friendship with the woman who some consider the greatest Scottish artist of the 20th century. While Eardley became beloved for her portraits of children, Morrison never painted the human figure. Instead, he focused on the skies and landscape of Angus and the Mearns that would become a distinctive feature of his work. Morrison’s quest for meaning in the landscape took him, ultimately, to the least populated part of the planet – the high arctic reaches of Canada and Greenland.

‘I had no idea what I was getting into,’ Morrison says wryly, settling into an extraordinary tale, which includes hair-raising flights over glaciers and arctic bison, and a confrontation with a polar bear, all the result of his determination to paint the vanishing arctic wilderness.

As Morrison returns to his studio to paint, there is a sense of time running out. His memory is now failing as well, and he needs to refer to a piece of paper in his pocket to remember the director’s name. 

A new solo exhibition of his work in Edinburgh – his twenty-fifth – is soon to be mounted at The Scottish Gallery. Despite his worsening sight, Morrison has promised the organisers one last work.

As he shuffles through half a dozen different pairs of glasses, he expresses his frustration at not being able to focus his eyes on the canvas properly. But as he begins painting on a pristine white board, he miraculously summons up the energy of the brash young painter he once was, his brush flashing across the canvas, leaving behind great waves of lapis lazuli.

";"New film Belfast is Sir Kenneth Branagh’s account of his childhood in the early years of the Troubles. Tipped for Oscar glory and now released here, we speak to the man behind it.
";"New film Belfast sees Sir Kenneth Branagh return to the city of his childhood. It is an autobiographical exploration of the value of family life in the face of the gathering storm that became the Troubles - one which led to him leaving the city. 

Sir Kenneth became a household name while still in his 20s for his acclaimed work as an actor and director who breathed new life into the plays of Shakespeare. Later, he spread his wings as a writer and director of feature films. By his own admission, he has come a long way from Belfast - yet his new film sees him return to his formative years in the city with the meticulous monochrome recreation of the tightly-packed streets he knew so well. The film’s cast includes Dame Judi Dench, Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, Catriona Balfe and newcomer Jude Hill.   

Sir Kenneth talks at length about his new film - what drove him to write it, working with the actors and even his refusal to water down the Belfast accent for international distribution. He also discusses his own childhood experiences of being caught up in rioting as both bystander and participant, his parents’ zest for life and how leaving the city left a deep mark on him.";Arts;BBC ONE NORTHERN IRELAND;False;2022;29;arts;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0bhph85.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0bhph85.jpg;new film belfast see sir kenneth branagh return city childhood autobiographical exploration value family life face gathering storm became trouble one led leaving city sir kenneth became household name still 20 acclaimed work actor director breathed new life play shakespeare later spread wing writer director feature film admission come long way belfast yet new film see return formative year city meticulous monochrome recreation tightlypacked street knew well film ’ cast includes dame judi dench jamie dornan ciaran hind catriona balfe newcomer jude hill sir kenneth talk length new film drove write working actor even refusal water belfast accent international distribution also discus childhood experience caught rioting bystander participant parent ’ zest life leaving city left deep mark;1

The Met is open, but in a safe and very limited way. Visitor income helps keep the museum running, so times are hard. Since it was founded, like so many US arts institutions, the Metropolitan has largely been funded by benefactors. We visit Clyde B Jones III, the executive matching modern donors to exhibitions and events as the economy tanks.
 
Jones explains how hard it is to keep up the social links that the system depends on. He has, nonetheless, found it possible to drum up millions of dollars for the imminent remodelling of the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas galleries. Currently, the need to shade the massive south-facing glass wall that illuminates the rooms means artefacts are not shown to their best advantage. Now he must find the funds to replace those walls.
 
Some give money, but others donate items from their own collections. We meet curator Jaysen Dobney of the musical instruments department as a rock musician and long-term patron asks for help with his problem, a collection of 403 guitars. Dobney is only too happy to have a promised gift of a 60s Gibson Les Paul TV Special.

Every department is currently calling on its supporters. In Textile Conservation, Head Curator Janina Poskrobko makes breakfast for a visiting professor. We've been with her since dawn, at home in Staten island, saying her prayers. She must find the money for an unfunded project - the rescue of an Ottoman robe. We observe as she subtly raises the issue while showing him a Renaissance cape. The professor is a textile expert and passionate supporter. Might he dig deep?

The Costume Institute is normally funded by stars who pay to attend the famous Met Gala fashion event, but this year they're economising. The 2020 Ball is cancelled, so 2019's proceeds must be used carefully. We follow the building of About Time as the set undergoes construction and the garments are installed.
 
Meanwhile, fashionable friends are stepping up. In Detroit, America's most flamboyant private collector of couture, Sandy Shrier, opens her home, and her heart, to explain why the Met is so important to her - and why last year she donated 160 garments amassed over seven decades of collecting.

In London, we are with top-end cobbler Georgina Goodman, who has just taken a call from the Met, asking for help bolstering their huge accessories archive. In the mid-2000s, Goodman attracted the attention of couturier Alexander McQueen. Packing up her sketches, the designer reveals how she was charged with interpreting Lee McQueen's footwear visions, including the iconic armadillo shoe. The Met has a pair, but is keen to acquire Goodman's original sketches.  
 
As Covid keeps visitor numbers low, every ticket purchased helps keep the lights on and the building open. With no tourist trade, the Met is back to where it began in 1870, catering for locals. Citizens are not obliged to pay for entry into the museum, but Naqiya Hussein has bought two tickets. She's joining the many young people, newly unlocked but making only tentative outings, on a Met Date. Her scientist beau Cyril and she enjoy the tranquillity of solitude in her favourite galleries, though the camera is ever present. A date here is a litmus test of love. If the million objects on display can't spark a conversation, it's never going to work.

Perhaps the greatest donation is a lifetime of work at the Met - or the possibility at least. We are with Vietnamese-American student Kevin Pham as he visits the medieval department at the Met Cloisters in northern Manhattan. He's one of 120 postgraduate interns, paid through a new $5M donation to study with a view to a possible career in the museum. The Met wants to build a new and diverse staff, and must succeed if it is to remain relevant. As Kevin says, the museum can't be the preserve of bearded old white men.
 
At Halloween, About Time opens. The annual Costume Institute show is always a blockbuster that draws in the crowds, and now the stakes are high. The newly reopened Met must show that it is still the place for fashion as art. This anniversary year, a mirrored gallery, packed with black garments from across 150 years, points to objects that are timeless in an industry now driven by constant change. We're with fashionistas as they thrill to the show, noting that even on a budget, Curator Andrew Bolton has managed to make a splash.
 
Philanthropy has always kept the Met alive and vibrant, and as the nights draw in, there's disquiet about the upcoming US election and its effect on giving. A change of administration, or the return of President Trump, might warp the delicate web of tax breaks and write-offs that underpin the whole arts world.

Blending discourse with mythology, interview with autobiography, geomancy with geopolitics, the intimate and the celestial, this explosive collage is a retort to our troubled moment of multiple crises. 

Spanning performance, animation, interviews (including with artist Bob and Roberta Smith), text and original music composition, the 14-minute video-essay is a whirlwind of eight exercises for the body and mind.  

Playful yet poignant, coy yet in-your-face, poetic yet pungent, it argues that in such times of despair, art can remind us to imagine how things can be, and that each of us must play an active part. Drawing on the words of Lorde, Bretch, Beckett, Abdelkader Benali and more, it calls on viewers to (re-)imagine, and act on, how things can become. 

The film builds on the director’s efforts since the pandemic, which are advancing conversations around creativity and neurodiversity, and the socio-political role of ‘artfulness’.

Does Kali find happiness at last?;"Gnu, the wildebeest calf, and Shani’s foal face the greatest challenge of their young lives. They must cross the treacherous river. Shani and her foal are first to attempt the crossing, but the crocodiles have been waiting for this moment. If her foal survives, another huge challenge awaits – a wall of angry hippos will be blocking his way.

Tamu, the young gazelle, is now orphaned and trying to stay alive. Zalika is the first in line to try her luck, but Tamu learnt a trick or two from his mother.

Bakari has quelled the rebellion for now, but with the sudden arrival of thousands of wildebeest and zebra, finding a way through the herds is dangerous for all. Bakari must lead them all safely back to his old home. 

When Aiysha gets injured during a hunt, her family’s fate hangs in the balance. The cubs are still inexperienced hunters and their situation looks dire. Can Duma pick up the mantle and provide for his family?

Kali is still being followed by Askari, but he’s not quite as threatening as he once seemed. Just as romance appears to be blossoming, their liaison is interrupted by angry buffalo and later by elephants. Could Kali’s old enemy become the protector she has always longed for? 

Gnu still has to cross the river, but a seemingly insurmountable series of challenges awaits. First, he faces a suicidal drop from sheer cliffs to the river below, and that’s before he tackles the treacherous currents and meets the waiting crocodiles. Even getting out is a near impossible task as the sheer number of wildebeest creates a deadly blockade. In the chaos, he becomes separated from his mother. Has she succumbed to the fate of so many others?

As the series comes to a dramatic end, there is hope for the future. The neverending story of life on the plains continues.

Each one - from the song of the largest lemur to the song of the humpback whale to the song of the lyrebird - was recorded in his lifetime.

When Sir David was born, the science of song had already been transformed by Charles Darwin’s theory of sexual selection: singing is dangerous as it reveals the singer’s location to predators, but it also offers the male a huge reward, the chance to attract a female and pass on genes to the next generation. Hence males sing and females don't. 

Today, new science in the field of birdsong is transforming those long-held ideas. Scientists are discovering that, in fact, in the majority of all songbird species, females sing - and it is only now they are being properly heard. Through this revelation and others, we can understand that animal songs are marvelous examples of the spectacular survival strategies that species have developed in order to stay alive.

Extinction is now happening up to 100 times faster than the natural evolutionary rate, but the issue is about more than the loss of individual species. Everything in the natural world is connected in networks that support the whole of life on earth, including us, and we are losing many of the benefits that nature provides to us. The loss of insects is threatening the pollination of crops, while the loss of biodiversity in the soil also threatens plants growth. Plants underpin many of the things that we need, and yet one in four is now threatened with extinction.   

Last year, a UN report identified the key drivers of biodiversity loss, including overfishing, climate change and pollution. But the single biggest driver of biodiversity loss is the destruction of natural habitats.   Seventy-five per cent of Earth's land surface (where not covered by ice) has been changed by humans, much of it for agriculture, and as consumers we may unwittingly be contributing towards the loss of species through what we buy in the supermarket. 

Our destructive relationship with the natural world isn’t just putting the ecosystems that we rely on at risk. Human activities like the trade in animals and the destruction of habitats drive the emergence of diseases.   Disease ecologists believe that if we continue on this pathway, this year’s pandemic will not be a one-off event.

At Slievemoyle farm, Mark McCormick from the RSPB is camping out for a dawn chorus survey. Coming home and working with nature has helped him get over PTSD from witnessing the Westminster Bridge terror attacks. He is hoping he will hear the distinctive call of the endangered yellowhammer.

Summers on Strangford Lough mean long evenings stretching into glorious sunsets. The Crawford family enjoy an evening picnic, while in Portaferry, four generations of the Murray family take the St Brendan out for an evening of fishing.

Summer is regatta season on the lough, and a big moment for Kenny Smyth and his River-class sailing boat Laragh. It’s 100 years since the Rivers were built, and Kenny is hoping to wrestle the series race trophy from his brother Graham.

Away from the buzz of summer activities, Katy Bell is hoping to find healthy barn owl chicks. Wet and extremely hot weather has meant most of the sites have failed this year, but a new site may have some healthy chicks.

How can we mitigate the effects of light pollution so that the beauty of the night sky captured by Van Gogh might be preserved in the real world for future generations?

Images and data from satellites have made it easy for us to visualise the extent of the growing effects of light pollution around the world, but speaking with Professor Kevin Gaston from the University of Exeter, Chris discovers that our current estimates show that global light pollution could be much worse than past data suggests. Without satellites capable of analysing the light emitted from the now-popular bluer LED lighting, he estimates that the true levels of light pollution could be around 200% more than was previously thought. Kevin and Chris discuss how light pollution is not just a problem for astronomers but can have devastating effects on animal behaviour and human health.

Pete Lawrence visits one of the few places in the UK where you might still be able to catch a glimpse of the Milky Way. In Moore’s Reserve, named after Sir Patrick Moore, Pete meets up with Dark Skies Officer and South Down National Park ranger Dan Oakley, whose public outreach and passion for astronomy helped to get Dark Sky Reserve status for the area. Together they talk about the way towns and cities might change to help create more dark sky areas for the public to enjoy. 

In contrast, atop Television Centre in London - one of the country’s brightest cities – Chris joins the Baker Street Irregular Astronomers under a bright city night sky. The group demonstrate some tips and tricks to show us that, no matter where you are, you can still view and image some spectacular night sky objects.

For each stage of life we see the most spectacular, beautiful or dramatic stories from the Life Story series.

The journey begins with one of the most talked-about sequences - flightless barnacle goose chicks making an extraordinary leap down a cliff face from the ledge where they hatched. Newly independent arctic foxes travel great distances across the frozen, northern landscape, learning how to catch prey. They leap high into the air and plunge nose-first into the snow to catch the lemmings living underneath.

In pursuit of a home, tropical hermit crabs do something seen nowhere else in nature. They form an orderly queue, largest at the front, smallest at the back. It's a housing chain. When the chain is complete there is a mass swap as each crab moves into the newly vacated shell ahead of it in the line. In meerkat society, a youngster must quickly learn how to defend home and family from snakes. In a spectacular showdown between the meerkat clan and a venomous cobra, the youngsters learn a vital life lesson. 

In a sequence that has since gone viral across the globe, a tiny, drab male puffer fish creates the most complex and beautiful structure made by any animal on earth. He builds a spectacular submarine 'crop circle' in the sand to attract a female's attention.

Travellers;Chris discovers the cleverest animal travellers and how they find their way.;Chris discovers the cleverest animal travellers and how they find their way, from deer with mental maps, blue whales planning routes, and dung beetles navigating by the stars.;"Chris Packham discovers the clever methods that animals use to travel from A to B and how they find their way. Whether it is a local trip to find food or an epic journey to reach a safe place to breed, every traveller must work out where to go and the most energy-efficient way to get there. 

Now, the latest scientific research is helping uncover just how they do it, from creating mental maps of their environment to planning their route with precision. We are only starting to understand how these intelligent travellers get around successfully, but by studying their movements we may also learn valuable insights that could help us, like ways to manage crowd safety and to how to tackle cancer more effectively.

Chris begins by meeting Bertie and Baxter, two beautiful Bactrian camels that demonstrate how they are perfectly adapted to trekking across harsh deserts. With long eyelashes and special eyelids to keep out sand, broad feet so they do not sink, and the ability to go without water for up to a week, these camels can cover 25 miles a day, and helped humans travel and trade for thousands of years.  

In America, Rhiannon Jakopak from the University of Wyoming is part of a research team collaring and tracking mule deer across the state. They are finding that mule deer are constantly collecting details about the environment and their position within it, allowing them to learn migration routes passed down the generations, and even occasionally learning their own new routes. 

Some ocean migrants are also showing impressive brainpower, as Dr Briana Abhrams from the University of Washington has discovered. Her research has shown blue whales use their memories to migrate, letting them predict where and when there will be a steady supply of food all along the west coast of North America, as they undertake their epic 4,000-mile-long migration.

Elephants have a reputation for never forgetting, and it seems their memory can help them find valuable resources. Sophie Sadera is a safari guide in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and she knows first-hand how elephants use the same pathways every year as they travel to find water. During times of drought matriarchs can use their memory of water sources they have visited in the past to ensure their herd’s survival.

But you do not need to have a big brain to find your way around. The green and black poison dart frog lives in the rainforests of South America and is a master of mental maps. Brand new science has shown this tiny amphibian has got the mind to remember the structure of a rainforest, which is constantly changing, enabling them to transport their tadpoles to water sources within this dynamic environment. 

Exciting new research by Rickesh Patel, from the University of Maryland Baltimore County, has revealed an excellent underwater navigator. By constantly monitoring the turns they take and the distance they travel, mantis shrimp can find their way back to their home. This suggests they use a navigational strategy called path integration. They are currently the only underwater animal that we know of that is able to do this.   

Professor Marie Dacke, from Lund University in Sweden, has been studying dung beetles in South Africa for over 20 years, and her research has discovered that these insects have the remarkable ability to navigate at night using the light of the Milky Way. 

Some animal travellers use the most surprising ways to get around, and new science by the University of Bristol has shown how spiders can fly. By detecting static electricity in the air, they float along on silk lines. They have been found an impressive 1,000 miles out at sea, and up to two-and-a-half miles high in the air. 

But they are not the only surprising flyer, the Paradise Tree Snake can cover almost 100 metres in a single glide. Now, thanks to motion-capture technology, new research has revealed the science behind how they can glide and land safely. 

Some of the most exciting discoveries are coming from studying how animals travel en masse. Dr Iain Couzin, from the Max Planck Institute in Germany, is showing that bird flocks and fish shoals tap into a 'group mind' influencing how they travel. Their behaviour may hold answers to some human problems, like how to manage crowd safety and even new ways to treat cancer.

The Lake District National Park includes a beautiful stretch of Cumbria’s coast, where rare natterjack toads inhabit a spectacular sand dune landscape. But this rugged wilderness sits in the shadows of Sellafield, the most hazardous industrial site in western Europe, which is home to hundreds of aging and disused nuclear facilities - including the largest single stockpile of plutonium on the planet.

At a brand new training facility, Simon meets members of the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, an elite unit of armed police that is the UK’s first line of defence against an attack at a nuclear site. He is also given rare access to Sellafield’s aging facilities and some of the men and women tasked with clearing and securing over half a century of Britain’s nuclear waste. 

Further down the coast, Simon heads out to sea to visit a much less controversial part of Cumbria’s ‘Energy Coast’ – the second biggest offshore wind farm on earth. But greener energy alone won’t reduce carbon emissions enough to prevent global warming. Vast areas of the Lake District are boggy peatlands. Peat is dense, wet organic matter that stores enormous quantities of carbon. Simon heads up into the fells above Coniston to see a large project that is aiming to prevent the release of carbon from peatlands, reversing this process to restore the land to its former boggy glory. 

At the end of his travels through Cumbria, Simon meets James Rebanks, a shepherd and bestselling author who believes that farming could be the solution to many of our national problems, from the loss of wildlife to climate change.

This warm and honest documentary reveals how everyday people feel about the climate crisis.;"Britain has made big promises about reducing our impact on the planet, but getting there means huge changes to our everyday lives. In this surprising and funny documentary, we follow members of the UK’s first ever Citizen's Assembly on Climate Change, where 108 ordinary Brits are tasked with deciding what we should do to meet our climate change goals. 

Organised by Parliament, this historic event sees members of the public grapple with big questions about our future. As the assembly members learn the science of climate change from experts and hear Sir David Attenborough thank them for giving up their time for this task, they begin to realise the huge significance of the decisions they must make.

The film follows seven assembly members from all over the UK, who each bring their own perspective to the climate change debate. Sue, an ex-fishmonger from Bath, is shocked to learn the science of climate change, and when floods hit the UK - and the south west in particular - she begins to understand how close to home these issues can be and resolves to make personal changes. 

British Gas employee Marc from Newcastle is enthusiastic about taking part in the assembly, but is worried about losing his job in the transition to green energy, while 27-year-old postal worker Amy is unsettled when she learns the environmental impact of the coal fire she heats her home with. We also meet retired printer Richard, who is sceptical about climate change and reluctant to accept many of the proposals put forward in the assembly. But when his own health deteriorates, he is forced to re-examine the impact of dirty air on all our lives.

This edition is devoted to 19th-century achievements.;"In the final programme of the series uncovering the construction and engineering skills that went into the building of Britain, Fred Dibnah indulges his personal passion for the achievements of the builders of the 19th century. 

At Eastnor Castle in Herefordshire, a young architect called Robert Smirke was commissioned to build a grand house that was as big and impressive as a great medieval castle. As Fred demonstrates, steam-powered machinery made this possible in a fraction of the time - if not the cost - involved originally. 

Eastnor also provides an introduction to the work of architect and designer Augustus Welby Pugin, who was inspired by medieval Gothic architecture. At St Giles in Cheadle, Staffordshire, Fred examines one of Pugin's best Gothic works, achieved thanks to one of the finest teams of craftsmen that have ever been seen in the building of Britain. The building with which Pugin is most commonly associated is the Palace of Westminster, where he worked alongside fellow architect Sir Charles Barry. Fred reveals how the two men came up with a building that matched the medieval Westminster Abbey next door, as well as demonstrating how the builders overcame the challenges posed by the riverbank location.

What Is Our Future?;Professor Brian Cox concludes his exploration of our place in the universe.;Professor Brian Cox examines what lies ahead for humankind. On Svalbard, he gains access to civilisation's greatest treasure, buried deep in the permafrost.;"Professor Brian Cox concludes his exploration of our place in the universe by asking what next for the ape that went to space.

In northern Spain, he begins in a cave that was once home to our distant ancestors. Here, he discovers some of the earliest art in the universe - a child's hand painted onto the wall that has remained intact for around 40,000 years. That child - if raised today - would be just as bright and just as capable as any modern child. Yet its vision of the future would be very different to ours.

To understand what sets us apart, Brian heads to the Arctic. In Svalbard, he joins a group of people who are celebrating the midsummer sun. At these latitudes, the sun doesn't set for weeks on end. Brian shows how science is able to precisely predict the future passage of our star in ways our ancestors could not have imagined. The difference is that science has given us a vision of the deep future. It has shown us that we live in a clockwork universe where planets turn around stars in predictable orbits, stars around galaxies and the galaxies themselves are all falling through a probably infinite universe. 

But powerful as science is at predicting the motion of the heavens, our future is far from certain. In Florida, Brian joins the latest efforts to protect Earth from potential catastrophic events. He joins a team of Nasa astronauts who are training for a future mission to an asteroid - should we ever discover one coming our way - under 30 feet of water in a submerged laboratory that simulates space. It is just one example of how, for our long-term survival, space exploration may well be vital. It is a view shared by Apollo 16 astronaut Charlie Duke, who tells Brian what it was like to escape the confines of the planet. It is a dream that both Nasa and now commercial companies share as they race to get humans back into deep space.

But space travel, like every leap our civilisation has ever made, requires energy. Here too, scientists are hard at work attempting to safeguard our future. At the National Ignition Facility in California, Brian witnesses the world's most successful fusion experiment in action. He believes that if their mission succeeds, our civilisation will have unlocked a way to the stars that will not destroy the planet in the process.

Against All Odds;Animals facing the greatest odds have the most extraordinary mating strategies of all.;All life is driven by the need to breed. Yet for a few, the odds of success are overwhelmingly against them, and these animals have adopted the most extraordinary mating strategies of all.;"One basic need connects all life on earth - the need to breed. But for a few creatures, the odds of success are overwhelmingly stacked against them. Some must find a partner when there are none to be found, while others must find a way to succeed without breeding at all. And some must try to adapt in a world unrecognisable from when they were born. These are animals that have evolved some of the most extraordinary mating strategies of all, and now they face a new challenge in the most successful breeder of all: us.

The deep ocean is home to perhaps the most bizarre mating game of all. It’s the largest and least populated habitat on earth, and most of the creatures here spend their lives alone and in total darkness. So when a male fan-tailed anglerfish is lucky enough to stumble across a female, he clings on for dear life - and that ends up being the price he pays, as his body fuses with hers and his sole purpose becomes the fertilisation of her eggs. He gives so much of himself to her that when she dies, so will he.

Toad-headed agamas spend their lives on the sand dunes of southern Russia. They need burrows in which to lay their eggs, but this isn’t easy when their homes can be swallowed up before their eyes in the ever-shifting sands. Meanwhile, for one laysan albatross, finding a place to breed isn’t so much of a problem, but finding a partner is a real struggle. Laysan pair for life, but when there are not enough males to go around, different tactics are required. And for another iconic bird, an abundance of males leads to perhaps the most remarkable strategy of all. On the plains of Texas, dominant wild turkey males are aided by their less impressive brothers, who will help to keep rival males at bay whilst the top turkey secures as many mates as possible.

In North America, thousands of creatures have been hiding underground for 17 years for their chance to play the mating game. Periodical cicadas emerge from the ground in immense swarms to overwhelm predators and ensure the next generation of ground-dwellers. But a lot can change in so long a time, and their parents could not have predicted how different the world would be for their offspring nor the challenges they would face in this brave new world.

This is just one of the ways in which the breeding success of humans is impacting the natural mating game of others. As a consequence of our success, we face a mass extinction event like no other in human history. But there is hope. Scientific breakthroughs have led to extraordinary solutions in helping other species to reproduce.

";"Gregg Wallace visits a huge vacuum cleaner factory in the heart of Somerset. This 32-acre site is a hive of activity where 1.2 million vacuums are made every year. Gregg is following their biggest seller, the Henry vacuum cleaner in bright red.

He starts with head of operations Stuart Cochrane, who is taking delivery of 25 tonnes of clear polypropylene pellets. They are transported to the factory floor via a spaghetti junction of pipes and then mixed with a red colouring agent. A massive moulding machine heats the plastic pellets and forces them into a drum-shaped mould under 300 tonnes of clamp pressure, the equivalent weight of 24 London buses. There are 47 of these huge moulding machines in the factory, churning out a total of 5,000 vacuums every day.

Next, Gregg’s vacuum needs a bit of personality. The famous smile was drawn on for the first time as a joke by an employee at a trade show, but it attracted so much attention that it quickly became a permanent fixture. It is created using a process called PAD printing. Silicone pads are dipped in ink and pressed onto the surface of the moulded plastic ‘face’ to create the eyes and smile, after which it is cured under heat to dry the ink.
 
With the drum and face moulded and printed, and wheels made from moulded recycled plastic, the bottom half of the vacuum is assembled in less than a minute. Timing is crucial - the drum is still hot from the moulding machine, so the wheels must be slotted in before the plastic cools and shrinks.  

Now for the top half of the vacuum cleaner, which starts with a moulded motor housing. The motor needs power, so Gregg meets with wiring section manager Nathan Bandy at the loom assembly station. Nathan explains that the wiring loom is a cluster of cables that connect to the on/off switch, transmitting electricity to the motor. 

With so many electrical and mechanical parts in each vacuum, the factory has its own on-site testing centre. Gregg can’t quite believe his eyes, as everywhere he looks, they are being put through their paces. It is like a torture chamber for vacuum cleaners! 

Back at the factory, the top half of Gregg’s vacuum is coming together, and the shiny top cover is emerging from another moulding machine. 

Next, Gregg is sent off in search of a set of ‘wands’ for his vacuum, and project manager Roy Poole has the magic touch. The wands start life as 422mm stainless steel tubes which are fed into a machine that reduces one end by 1mm and stretches the other by 1.75, so they will slot neatly together to form a solid link between the brushes and the hose. 

At last, the components can be brought together at the final assembly station, and it happens fast! The lower housing forms the base, then the motor with a jacket of acoustic wrap. The upper motor housing drops in on top with the reeler and ten-metre-long cable coming in above, before it is all finished off with the shiny cover. The machine is plugged in and powered up to check the suction reaches a precise 225 millibar. Gregg is stunned to see that all the components come together in less than 30 seconds, before they’re checked, boxed up and sent to the dispatch area. 

The storage and distribution centre is 21,000 square feet, the size of nine tennis courts, and from there, the boxes of vacuums roll down a clever chute to one of the ten trucks that leave the factory every day, each carrying nearly 1,000 machines.";Food;BBC TWO;False;2022;59;science-and-nature, signed, food, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09232d3.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09232d3.jpg;gregg wallace visit huge vacuum cleaner factory heart somerset 32acre site hive activity 12 million vacuum made every year gregg following biggest seller henry vacuum cleaner bright red start head operation stuart cochrane taking delivery 25 tonne clear polypropylene pellet transported factory floor via spaghetti junction pipe mixed red colouring agent massive moulding machine heat plastic pellet force drumshaped mould 300 tonne clamp pressure equivalent weight 24 london bus 47 huge moulding machine factory churning total 5000 vacuum every day next gregg ’ vacuum need bit personality famous smile drawn first time joke employee trade show attracted much attention quickly became permanent fixture created using process called pad printing silicone pad dipped ink pressed onto surface moulded plastic ‘ face ’ create eye smile cured heat dry ink drum face moulded printed wheel made moulded recycled plastic bottom half vacuum assembled le minute timing crucial drum still hot moulding machine wheel must slotted plastic cool shrink top half vacuum cleaner start moulded motor housing motor need power gregg meet wiring section manager nathan bandy loom assembly station nathan explains wiring loom cluster cable connect onoff switch transmitting electricity motor many electrical mechanical part vacuum factory onsite testing centre gregg ’ quite believe eye everywhere look put pace like torture chamber vacuum cleaner back factory top half gregg ’ vacuum coming together shiny top cover emerging another moulding machine next gregg sent search set ‘ wand ’ vacuum project manager roy poole magic touch wand start life 422mm stainless steel tube fed machine reduces one end 1mm stretch 175 slot neatly together form solid link brush hose last component brought together final assembly station happens fast lower housing form base motor jacket acoustic wrap upper motor housing drop top reeler tenmetrelong cable coming finished shiny cover machine plugged powered check suction reach precise 225 millibar gregg stunned see component come together le 30 second ’ checked boxed sent dispatch area storage distribution centre 21000 square foot size nine tennis court box vacuum roll clever chute one ten truck leave factory every day carrying nearly 1000 machine;13

We meet the conservation heroes from across Wales, each doing their bit in many ways, to help marine conservation and promote the importance of the ocean: from fishermen sacrificing profits in return for sustainability and a plastic-waste campaigner who paddleboarded around Wales to raise awareness about the pollution of our oceans to a group of underwater scuba-diving litter-pickers and a surfer who uses the sea to help people with mental health issues. 

Many are also working directly to save marine wildlife, including a highly successful breeding programme to bring seahorses back to Welsh waters and remarkable organisations rescuing Atlantic grey seals and stranded whales. When the tide goes out, one group of young enthusiasts undertakes important species counts on Welsh shores, and another young marine biologist heads out to sea using a bait camera to film shark and other exciting species, which he records and then shares with the world via social media. 

We also join the remarkable world-leading Welsh Seagrass Project, led by a passionate scientist who is trying to plant a million seeds in Dale in Pembrokeshire.

At last offered treatment, her hopes for surgery are dashed by Covid-19. ;"Lipoedema is a condition thought to affect around 300,000 women in Scotland. It is a genetic disorder where abnormal fat cells lead to a disproportionate accumulation of weight in the middle of the body. It is highly debilitating, impacting not only on a woman’s appearance and general wellbeing, but on her mobility and state of mind. 

Lorna Taggart, from Isle of Skye, has battled lipoedema all her adult life. Broadcaster John McDiarmid is Lorna’s brother and has been filming with her since early 2019, not long after she was diagnosed. The film charts Lorna's journey from her teens through to today as a full-time teacher and mother of three, still facing a future dictated by a condition that very few understand, and that medical practitioners often fail to identify.

Between August and November, five horrifically violent murders took place in Whitechapel.  There was a huge manhunt, but the Ripper was never caught. Since then there has been endless speculation about who the Ripper was, what motivated his crimes, and how the killer escaped justice. 

Presented by the star of BBC One drama Silent Witness Emilia Fox and Britain’s top criminologist Professor David Wilson, this documentary casts new light on the Jack the Ripper case. Together Emilia and David look at the Ripper’s modus operandi using modern technology - like a digital autopsy table - and recreating the murder sites to help understand the extraordinary risks the Ripper took to kill his victims.  Also, using the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System (HOLMES), a bespoke computer system used by the police to help detect patterns in criminal activity, and evidence uncovered within the investigation, results strongly indicate that Martha Tabram was in fact the first Ripper victim.  

Convinced that Martha Tabram was the Ripper’s first victim, Emilia and David ask a geographical profiling expert to take a fresh look at the pattern of Ripper murder sites, which takes the investigation in a completely different direction, ultimately identifying the most likely suspect.

Can they be convinced that being green doesn’t have to cost the earth and can still be convenient?;"This week, Chris Bavin and Melanie Sykes help a time-stretched family with a new baby. Steve and Saskia live in Shrewsbury with their five-month-old daughter Cece and Saskia’s six-year-old daughter Edi. They are a family who would love to be greener but just can’t find the time to do it. Having a young family has prompted them both to start thinking about the planet and whether they can become more climate conscious, but a busy work and home life has meant that it’s convenience and not the planet that is taking priority. Can they be convinced that being greener doesn’t have to cost the earth or turn their lives upside down?

Before Chris and Melanie can help Saskia and Steve go greener, they raid their home, seeking out their biggest not-so-eco spends and secretly setting up a pop-up shop with their stuff. They want to show them where they think they could be greener and save some money along the way. To track their progress, Melanie and Chris reveal the family’s carbon footprint. Steve and Saskia are relieved to hear that they aren’t doing too badly, but this is short lived when they find out what we should all be aiming for. Determined to lower their carbon footprint, they get to work.

When the family are out, we go in and turn their home greener, swapping cleaning products they know and trust for eco-friendly alternatives and stripping their bathroom of single-use plastics. We even challenge them to give reusable nappies a go. Nothing is out of bounds: we even swap their favourite cheeses for vegan alternatives. And we don’t stop inside - Saskia’s beloved car is swapped for an electric one. 

Saskia thinks that vegan cooking will take more time and make more mess, so Jordan Banjo takes on the challenge. Together, they rustle up a katsu-style cauliflower that any meat eater would enjoy. Chris takes Steve to their local fruit and veg market to give him a crash course in how to buy seasonally, locally, sustainably and cheaply. Saskia is not a fan of plant-based milk, but Melanie wants them to do a blind taste test to see if they can tell which is which. Jo Page visits an Asda trial store that opened last year that is piloting ways to help customers shop more sustainably. And the great British public put a vegan version of a family favourite to the test: fishless fish fingers. Which plant-based fingers take top spot for our testers?

These worlds remain shadowy for a simple reason. Beyond Saturn, we have only ever visited the most distant planets once. 

Uranus – barely visible to the naked eye - was once thought to be the furthest planet from the Sun. But with the telescope and some careful viewing we discovered it had a companion: Neptune. Thanks to a rare alignment of the planets in 1976, Voyager 2 was sent for our only fly-by of these ice worlds. There we discovered far more vibrant planets than we ever imagined. Even at such cold temperatures, great storms whip around these frozen worlds that are home to spectacular moons and intricate ring systems. After a few hours of observation at each planet, Voyager 2 left them behind. We have never returned.

For decades that was as far as we got, until 2015 when Nasa’s New Horizons probe pushed the frontier even further into space. with its extraordinary passage to the dwarf planet Pluto. Once again, all our assumptions about this distant world were wrong. Pluto is alive with ice volcanoes, dunes, and geysers - even a subsurface ocean.

From humpback whales to waterfall-climbing fish, it is home to an extraordinary wealth of wildlife.;"This is a journey across Hawaii’s varied islands, discovering how they were made and the incredible wildlife that thrives there. 

Hawaii is the most remote island chain on earth, and its tropical shores are hard to reach. But for the hardy creatures that can make it here, like the waterfall-climbing fish, carnivorous caterpillar and Laysan albatross, a land of opportunity awaits. From newly formed lava fields to lush jungles and vibrant coral reefs, these diverse and beautiful islands have it all.

Packed with surprising stories, the hidden gems of this tropical paradise are uncovered using stunning photography. Dramatic footage of the humpback whale heat run – the biggest courtship battle in the world – and intimate views of the world’s oldest known bird feeding its chick are just some of the highlights of what Hawaii has to offer.

The islands are so isolated that it used to be that one new species arrived every 100,000 years, but the arrival of people has radically changed the face of Hawaii. Now it gains around 20 new species every year. The remarkable Jackson’s chameleon is one of the animals recently introduced. Showing off its voracious appetite, the programme reveals how it is eating its way through the native animals and contributing to wiping them out entirely.  

But this is a place where people are looking to the future and attempting to bring wildlife back from the brink of extinction. White terns, once extinct on the main islands of Hawaii, have gone from a single pair to over 2,000 birds in the last 60 years.

David starts out at the North Pole, standing on sea ice several metres thick, but which scientists predict could be open ocean within the next few decades. The Arctic has been warming at twice the global average, and David heads out with a Norwegian team to see what this means for polar bears. He comes face to face with a tranquilised female and discovers that mothers and cubs are going hungry as the sea ice on which they hunt disappears. In Canada, Inuit hunters have seen with their own eyes what scientists have seen from space - the Arctic Ocean has lost 30% of its summer ice cover over the last 30 years. For some, the melting sea ice will allow access to trillions of dollars' worth of oil, gas and minerals. For the rest of us, it means the planet will get warmer, as sea ice is important to reflect back the sun's energy. Next, David travels to see what is happening to the ice on land. In Greenland, he follows intrepid ice scientists as they study giant waterfalls of meltwater, which are accelerating iceberg-calving events and ultimately leading to a rise in global sea levels.

Temperatures have also risen in the Antarctic - David returns to glaciers photographed by the Shackleton expedition and reveals a dramatic retreat over the past century. It is not just the ice that is changing - ice-loving adelie penguins are disappearing and more temperate gentoo penguins are moving in.

Using cutting-edge technology in this extended special we celebrate the highlights from the series. From the intense heat of the tropics to our planet's frozen poles, through to its unexplored depths, we reveal new worlds and extraordinary never-seen-before animal behaviours.

Starting in the tropical coral reefs - the most diverse ocean habitat - a tusk fish demonstrates a surprising level of ingenuity - tool use - as it uses corals as an anvil to break open clams. In the Seychelles, half a million terns nest on an island. Fledglings must eventually take to the wing, but danger lurks beneath the waves: metre-long giant trevally fish leap clear out of the water to snatch birds on the wing.

In the tropics sun heats the sea, creating rain, winds and huge storms that drive up towards higher latitudes. Here the seas change with the seasons. In spring thousands of mobula rays gather in Mexico's Sea of Cortez. At night, in a previously unseen event, tiny organisms that light up when disturbed react to their wingbeats, creating an enchanting bioluminescent firework display.

The seasonal seas are home to bountiful kelp forests. In the undersea forests of southern Africa, one resident - the common octopus- has become the ultimate escape artist. To outwit her nemesis, the pyjama shark, she uses ingenious tactics, never filmed before. 

On the coast, two worlds collide. Where sea meets land, coasts are the most dynamic and challenging habitats in the ocean. The ever-changing tides create rock pools. But these temporary worlds are a battleground. Predatory starfish turn a magical garden into the stuff of nightmares.

The big blue is the world's greatest wilderness - it's a vast marine desert where there is little to eat and nowhere to hide. Sometimes there is a brief explosion of food in this marine desert, but ocean hunters must be fast to make the best of this bonanza. We witness super-pods of up to five thousand spinner dolphins racing to herd vast shoals of lanternfish, briefly caught at the surface where it is thought they spawn. New aerial footage reveals, for the first time, the spectacular feeding frenzy of 90kg tuna and dolphins smashing through the lantern fish shoals turning the sea white with foam.

The deep is perhaps the most hostile environment on Earth, at least to us - a world of crushing pressure, brutal cold and utter darkness. We have barely begun to explore it and yet it is the largest living space on our blue planet, home to strange worlds like methane volcanoes and undersea lakes of salty brine. But life adapts in ingenious ways, like the sea toad - a fish that walks instead of swims. And barrel-eye - a deep sea fish with a translucent skull so that it can see through the top of its head to make the most of any glimmer of light.

The deep is more closely connected to our own world than we ever thought possible due to giant ocean currents. We join these ocean currents as they begin their lives in Antarctica and flow from the poles to the tropics and back again, linking every ocean. Ocean currents move heat around our planet and maintain a climate favourable for life. But our ocean system, in relative equilibrium for millennia, is changing at a worrying rate.

Deep in the polar north, we meet walrus mothers and their newborn calves, searching for an ice floe to rest on; but with rising temperatures, summer sea ice is retreating- their battles to survive are becoming ever harder. As we begin to understand the true complexity of the lives of our ocean creatures so do we recognise the fragility of their home.";Nature;BBC ONE;False;2018;88;science-and-nature, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p05rrp4f.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p05rrp4f.jpg;recent year knowledge life beneath wave transformed using cuttingedge technology extended special celebrate highlight series intense heat tropic planet frozen pole unexplored depth reveal new world extraordinary neverseenbefore animal behaviour starting tropical coral reef diverse ocean habitat tusk fish demonstrates surprising level ingenuity tool use us coral anvil break open clam seychelles half million tern nest island fledgling must eventually take wing danger lurks beneath wave metrelong giant trevally fish leap clear water snatch bird wing tropic sun heat sea creating rain wind huge storm drive towards higher latitude sea change season spring thousand mobula ray gather mexico sea cortez night previously unseen event tiny organism light disturbed react wingbeats creating enchanting bioluminescent firework display seasonal sea home bountiful kelp forest undersea forest southern africa one resident common octopus become ultimate escape artist outwit nemesis pyjama shark us ingenious tactic never filmed coast two world collide sea meet land coast dynamic challenging habitat ocean everchanging tide create rock pool temporary world battleground predatory starfish turn magical garden stuff nightmare big blue world greatest wilderness vast marine desert little eat nowhere hide sometimes brief explosion food marine desert ocean hunter must fast make best bonanza witness superpods five thousand spinner dolphin racing herd vast shoal lanternfish briefly caught surface thought spawn new aerial footage reveals first time spectacular feeding frenzy 90kg tuna dolphin smashing lantern fish shoal turning sea white foam deep perhaps hostile environment earth least u world crushing pressure brutal cold utter darkness barely begun explore yet largest living space blue planet home strange world like methane volcano undersea lake salty brine life adapts ingenious way like sea toad fish walk instead swim barreleye deep sea fish translucent skull see top head make glimmer light deep closely connected world ever thought possible due giant ocean current join ocean current begin life antarctica flow pole tropic back linking every ocean ocean current move heat around planet maintain climate favourable life ocean system relative equilibrium millennium changing worrying rate deep polar north meet walrus mother newborn calf searching ice floe rest rising temperature summer sea ice retreating battle survive becoming ever harder begin understand true complexity life ocean creature recognise fragility home;8

A personal portrait of the crofting calendar on South Uist, past and present.

Made from rock as old as the moon, Uist has been shaped by winds, tides and the people who have continuously worked this landscape for 5,000 years. The traditional crofting methods enable rare species of birds and flowers to thrive that are extinct elsewhere in the British Isles. Conflicts arise from the dramatic weather system and the front-line cycles of life and death, and from the flocking geese.

Over the last 30 years, the resident population of Greylags has increased from less than 1,000 to over 9,000 birds. With little to check the breeding Greylag, the geese are destroying the cultivation of Uist corn.

It now faces an uncertain future as activists and investors demand change. Is the era of North Sea oil over?

This documentary draws on the voices of young activists, oil company executives, economists and pension fund managers to explore the vital questions that affect all our lives. We have 5-10 years to control our oil addiction, and yet the licensing of new oil fields such as the Cambo oil field off Shetland is seen to be in direct contradiction to the government’s alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement and hosting of COP. 

There is also a look at how the drama of global climate action is playing out in the fight over North Sea oil. Oil companies are convinced that they can continue to keep drilling while keeping to net zero ambitions through adopting new technologies, such as carbon capture. But climate scientists are deeply sceptical of the net zero concept and the time it would take for these technologies to be effective.

The film reveals the hidden infrastructure of oil from the offshore rigs and the buried pipelines, to its flow through the stock markets of London. As the North Sea industry struggles to meet the need to cut carbon emissions, oil workers see their livelihoods under threat, and investors seek to protect their assets.

Home;Brian Cox considers what it is about our world that makes it a home for life.;Brian Cox considers what it is about our world that makes it a home for life and asks what transformed this once barren planet into the earth we know today.;"As far as we know, there is only one place in the universe on which life has taken hold - earth - but for how much longer will this distinction remain? Astronomers are on the brink of finding other worlds the same size as earth and the same distance from their star. Professor Brian Cox considers what it is about our world that has made it a home and asks what ingredients are necessary to turn a tiny spec of rock in space into a living, vibrant planet.
 
To find out, Brian has come to one of earth's richest and most bio-diverse territories, Mexico. He begins by diving in search of our most essential ingredient in a beautiful azure sink hole or cenote, a characteristic feature and primary water source in southern Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. He then travels aboard the spectacular Copper Canyon Railway to measure the impact that the sun has on our planet, discovering how early life had to learn to survive under its glare in ways that still survive in us all today. 
 
At the end of the train journey, he arrives in Mexico's beautiful mountain interior, where he uncovers how the relationship life has with the sun has led to one on the most astonishing of all life's inventions: photosynthesis. By turning sunlight into energy,  life has tapped a seemingly endless energy source and introduces a vital ingredient to the planet's atmosphere - oxygen.
 
Finally, Brian visits a remote enclave high up in the pine forests of central Mexico to witness one of nature's greatest sights, the arrival of the monarch butterflies. Each year they make one of the longest migrations of all the butterfly species, over 4,000 kilometres from northern Canada to Mexico, by tapping into one the most elusive, intangible and perhaps rarest planetary ingredients of them all.";Science & Nature;BBC TWO;False;2013;59;science-and-nature, from-the-archives, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09xh7pd.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09xh7pd.jpg;far know one place universe life taken hold earth much longer distinction remain astronomer brink finding world size earth distance star professor brian cox considers world made home asks ingredient necessary turn tiny spec rock space living vibrant planet find brian come one earth richest biodiverse territory mexico begin diving search essential ingredient beautiful azure sink hole cenote characteristic feature primary water source southern mexico yucatan peninsula travel aboard spectacular copper canyon railway measure impact sun planet discovering early life learn survive glare way still survive u today end train journey arrives mexico beautiful mountain interior uncovers relationship life sun led one astonishing life invention photosynthesis turning sunlight energy life tapped seemingly endless energy source introduces vital ingredient planet atmosphere oxygen finally brian visit remote enclave high pine forest central mexico witness one nature greatest sight arrival monarch butterfly year make one longest migration butterfly specie 4000 kilometre northern canada mexico tapping one elusive intangible perhaps rarest planetary ingredient;8

He abseils into a hidden gorge, canoes across a reservoir, and meets the local llamas while following a riverside trail along the Nidd.

Grab your boots and join adventurer Amar Latif as he takes us on a journey along one of Yorkshire’s most surprising rivers. As a blind man with a passion for outdoor adventure, Amar discover how the stunning landscape along the River Nidd has been shaped, while abseiling into a hidden canyon, discovering the remains of an abandoned village, canoeing over Bradford’s water supply and meeting the local llamas.

Amar’s 13-mile route takes in the most stunning parts of this unique river valley. It’s the place where mysterious gorges have been carved out over thousands of years, where villages have been left abandoned after huge civil engineering projects, and where the farms of the future are taking hold in the landscape. It is packed with intriguing history, stunning nature and incredible views. 

We hear how Amar was introduced to outdoor adventure after he became blind when he was 18. Climbing Yorkshire’s Three Peaks was his first major challenge so the scenery of North Yorkshire still means the world to him.

His journey starts at Scar House Reservoir, where the source of the Nidd rises dramatically behind the dam wall. He starts his journey by canoe with a local instructor, paddling across the reservoir – before he explores the remains of a mysterious vanishing village that was once home to 1,250 people. With impressive archive pictures, he discovers how it housed families working on the revolutionary reservoir project which now provides most of Bradford’s water supply. Remains include the projection booth of a stunning 600-seat cinema.

Amar’s journey then continues down the Nidd valley – where the landscape is rapidly changing. Farmer Martyn Brown has turned his back on sheep and crops, and spent this year planting 10,000 trees on his 970-acre farm by the Nidd. He is part of a movement to revolutionise the way farms connect with nature. Amar meets him to investigate how this farm is transforming the fortunes of the local wildlife – and also helps out with a spot of dry stone walling to stop the sheep nibbling the new trees.

Walking with his guide, Amar then heads up and over the moor before descending to the dramatic How Stean Gorge. On the way, there is a brief stop at Middlesmoor where he explains how blind people can still enjoy stunning views like this.

Putting on his wetsuit, Amar then takes on a spectacular limestone ravine carved out over thousands of years by the power of the river. With instructor Tony Liddy, he abseils 45 feet into the gorge below. With specialist waterproof cameras, they explore a hidden area of incredible beauty and examine the natural rock formations and how the gorge came to be. 

Continuing downstream, with stunning aerials and idyllic filming, Amar and his guide continue to Pateley Bridge – stopping to help catch wild brown trout on the river.

Amar then heads to what is officially the oldest sweet shop in England. Tasting the old classics, operating the vintage confectionary machines and talking all things sweet with its charismatic owner, Amar revels in the nostalgia that brings so many visitors to this beautiful village.

His journey then continues down the river valley – as the autumn leaves line the path as the river widens. His journey concludes by meeting a remarkable farmer’s wife. After going to buy a horse and coming home with a llama ten years ago, Suzanne Benson is the proud owner of a llama trekking farm in the beautiful countryside beside the River Nidd. Suzanne takes Amar on a llama trek, where he reflects on how he was in Peru when he last came across one, and wonders if a llama would make for a good guide dog replacement. They finish with a scenic trek overlooking this unique part of the Yorkshire Dales.

The Big Bang: Before the Dawn;Why are we here? Brian Cox journeys back 13.8 billion years to the origin of the universe.;It’s the ultimate question: why are we here? Brian Cox explores how cutting-edge space missions take us back 13.8 billion years to the origin of the universe.;"Professor Brian Cox asks the ultimate question: how did the universe come to be? It is daunting in its scale. We live on one planet of eight that orbit just one of the 400 billion stars in our galaxy, which in turn is one of trillions in the universe. Yet it is amongst those galaxies that we have been able to unravel the story of the universe’s creation. Thanks to a series of discoveries, our most powerful space missions have unravelled 13.8 billion years of cosmic evolution and revealed the story of our universe from its birth all the way to the arrival of our nascent civilisation. 

Our guide on this odyssey back to the dawn of time is light. Telescopes are time machines - by looking out into the distant universe, they open a window to the past. One telescope more than any other has helped us journey through the history of the universe: NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. Over the course of three decades, Hubble has shown us cosmic evolution in action – including stars and planets being born and galaxies colliding. Remarkably, Hubble has even found one of the first galaxies ever to exist in the universe, which was born some 13.4 billion years ago. It's a discovery that hints at the beginnings of our own Milky Way. Vivid CGI brings this ancient galaxy to life, allowing us to witness for ourselves the first dawn. It was the beginning of a relationship between stars and planets that would, on a faraway world, lead to the origin of life - and ultimately to us.

Hubble’s incredible discoveries have allowed scientists to piece together much of our cosmic story, but it cannot take us back to the most important moment in history: the Big Bang. For decades, the moment the universe began was the subject of pure speculation, but by combining astronomy and cosmology, scientists have finally found a way to put their theories to the test and study the momentous events that took place during the Big Bang. They can do this because the European Space Agency’s Planck space telescope has seen the afterglow of the Big Bang itself – something we call the cosmic microwave background. The unparalleled detail Planck gave us has helped confirm something remarkable: the Big Bang may not be the beginning. There was a time before the dawn – a place beyond anything we can comprehend. Brian transports us back to the fraction of a second before the Big Bang, when the seeds of our universe were planted.

Earth has been through at least five mass extinction events, most of which have been caused by cataclysmic volcanic eruptions. It’s not the lava or ash that wiped out life, but an invisible gas released by volcanoes: carbon dioxide. 

Through compelling animal-led stories and expert interviews, we discover how CO2 is destabilising our planet. We meet rescued orphaned elephants in Kenya, victims of ever worsening droughts, and join ocean patrols off the coast of Gabon fighting to save endangered sharks. In the Amazon, we witness wildlife teams saving animals in the shrinking forests, and in San Diego we enter a cryogenic zoo preserving the DNA of endangered species before they become extinct. 

Almost every part of modern life depends on energy created by burning fossil fuels, and this produces CO2 in huge amounts. Humans are now acting like a super-volcano, releasing carbon dioxide at an even greater rate than the prehistoric mega-eruptions that extinguished life in the past. Globally, we now release 100 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of Earth's volcanoes combined.

The greatest change to be made is in how we create energy, and the planet is brimming with natural power that can help us do just that. It’s these forces of nature - the wind, the sun, waves and geothermal energy - that hold the key to our future.";Nature;BBC ONE;False;2021;58;science-and-nature, signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09234t5.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09234t5.jpg;earth living world know new force threatens perfect planet force u human changing planet rapidly ’ affecting earth ’ life support system weather ocean living world understand going wrong must look past earth least five mass extinction event caused cataclysmic volcanic eruption ’ lava ash wiped life invisible gas released volcano carbon dioxide compelling animalled story expert interview discover co2 destabilising planet meet rescued orphaned elephant kenya victim ever worsening drought join ocean patrol coast gabon fighting save endangered shark amazon witness wildlife team saving animal shrinking forest san diego enter cryogenic zoo preserving dna endangered specie become extinct almost every part modern life depends energy created burning fossil fuel produce co2 huge amount human acting like supervolcano releasing carbon dioxide even greater rate prehistoric megaeruptions extinguished life past globally release 100 time carbon dioxide atmosphere earth volcano combined greatest change made create energy planet brimming natural power help u ’ force nature wind sun wave geothermal energy hold key future;8

He was the first to film many of their beautiful and often bizarre displays, and over his lifetime he has tracked them all over the jungles of New Guinea. In this very personal film, he uncovers the remarkable story of how these 'birds from paradise' have captivated explorers, naturalists, artists, film-makers and even royalty. He explores the myths surrounding their discovery 500 years ago, the latest extraordinary behaviour captured on camera and reveals the scientific truth behind their beauty: the evolution of their spectacular appearance has in fact been driven by sex.

And in a final contemporary twist to this story of obsession and royalty, he travels to the desert of Qatar, to a state-of-the-art facility which houses the largest breeding group of these birds in the world - a sheikh's very own private collection. There he has his closest ever encounter with a greater bird of paradise and its dramatic display, reliving the experience that captivated him in the forests of New Guinea more than 50 years ago.

Using state-of-the-art cameras to film groundbreaking new behaviour, the programme unveils the fascinating worlds that are often out of reach to regular camera crews.   

Care and consideration for the wildlife is a priority as discreet and lightweight on-board devices are deployed to film the animals. Wearing the cameras, these creatures give us a unique perspective, carrying out the detective work that will help scientists to answer vital questions about their lives.  

In this episode, the brains behind our tiny cameras, Chris Watts, works with biologists and researchers to develop bespoke cameras tough enough for the Australian landscape, withstanding the heat and the height that the animals have to live with. The results take us airborne and under the cover of night.   

In New South Wales, Gordon encounters a marsupial facing a complex set of challenges when he meets a population of kangaroos that are being pushed to the very brink by a coastal development boom. How are they surviving on the edge of this urban expansion? Gordon meets the scientists driven to find out more about what the roos are feeding on as they are pushed onto the coastal fringes. As we become immersed in their world, we get a better understanding of kangaroos' social lives and the impact of human encroachment on their diet. 

In southern Australia, we head to Adelaide, where one of the team’s toughest challenges yet is to create the lightest of cameras to find out what the lure of the big city is to a colony of newly arrived fruit bats. Their appearance is a bit of a puzzle. Are they a threat to the local commercial fruit crops or have they found other ways to adapt to city life? For the first time ever, the fruit bats take our cameras up above the cityscape, showing us a unique view of their nocturnal worlds while providing information crucial to their future. 

In Queensland, we help scientists find out if koalas really deserve their dozy daytime reputation when we join researchers at a reserve to discover some incredible revelations surrounding their night-time manoeuvres. The team’s tech allows us to shadow them after sundown, unveiling their remarkable agility and surprising navigational skills.

In the aftermath of a huge fire, which families made it through alive?;"In this final episode, it’s time to close another chapter in the lives of the animals of the Serengeti, the end of an extraordinary year for them all. But first, all around is a blackened smoking wasteland, the aftermath of the huge fire. Which of the families made it out alive and who is still missing?

Torrential rain brings hope and the land is reborn into a green paradise as water quenches the scorched earth. Mirroring the changes in the landscape, the cycle of death and rebirth comes to the fore as the Serengeti’s elders prepare their young for adulthood and a life on their own. 

Lioness Kali is alive, but one of her three cubs is missing. Kike the cheetah returns and must train her grown-up cubs to survive on their own. The short, lush grasslands make the perfect training grounds for her lessons of survival. She teaches them to stalk, chase and trip their prey. A giraffe, grieving over the unexplained death of her calf, interrupts the cubs’ training regime. Leader of the wild dogs Jasari is also showing his pups how to survive on their own, but when he teaches them to fight off hyenas, they too are interrupted by the grieving giraffe. 

In the flooded river, elephant matriarch Nalla’s baby struggles in the torrents. Bakari returns when a huge fight with a rival baboon troop threatens his family, and he shows his bravery once more. 

Kali has yet more surprises in store which bring hope for her and her pride’s future. Kike has to leave her cubs and hope that they are ready for independence. With the death of an old male elephant, all the families come together and old rivalries end in a remarkable truce. 

With a new regime in place among the baboons, the harmony of nature is restored and for now, the future is bright for the families of the Serengeti.

After 30 years of filming the world’s most iconic creatures, Colin heads back to Ireland, to a garden he spent his childhood summers spraying and mowing into a perfect lawn. But now he wants to transform his old playground into a sanctuary for the native plants and animals now struggling to survive on these islands, and inspire viewers to do the same.

This episode takes us through Colin's second year as he begins to reap the rewards of his labours. Working through the winter, Colin reflects on his journey so far and plans the busy spring and summer months ahead. With most of the heavy lifting done, Colin will now use a gentle hand to maintain the garden as he tries to lure back as many wild creatures as possible. Early on, he is treated to a great surprise as a creature he has not spotted here for over 40 years makes a remarkable return - the elusive red squirrel. He takes this as a good omen for the year ahead – he must be doing something right!

As we move through the seasons, more and more creatures arrive, some more welcome than others. A small herd of deer begin to make nightly visits to feast on young trees, and Colin reluctantly serves them an eviction notice. Early spring sees temperatures rising and the ponds bursting with life. Clouds of insects take to the wing and, after some nocturnal visitors, frog spawn appears as if by magic. The native meadow comes into its own, attracting over a dozen different kind of butterflies and clouds of aerial predators.

Colin meets Professor Dave Goulson at his own wild patch in East Sussex to chat about his work on bumblebees and his crazy dream for the British countryside. He visits a tiny wild corner of central London that 70 years ago was just rubble from buildings bombed in the Blitz, and is now home to over 450 native species of plants and animals.

With exclusive interviews, archive footage and drama reconstruction.;"Documentary telling the incredible true story of Scottish mercenary Peter McAleese, who was hired to kill Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar in 1989. With unprecedented access to Peter and other members of his team, this is the first full account of that fateful mission and the dark consequences for those involved.

With full access to McAleese’s personal archive, as well as never-before-seen amateur footage of the operation, Killing Escobar weaves this material alongside dramatic reconstruction and interviews from McAleese and his fellow mercenaries. We also hear from one of Pablo Escobar’s bodyguards, members of America’s DEA and the security chief of the Colombian drug cartel that wanted Escobar eliminated.

The film also provides a deeply personal character study of Peter McAleese, a man trained to fight and kill, and the cost this has had on himself and his family. McAleese actively sought out war and conflict but admits that he, and those close to him, paid a costly price for his desire to seek adventure.

McAleese’s youth in postwar working class Glasgow was marked by poverty and violence and he quickly learned how to fight. Leaving Glasgow for the Parachute Regiment in 1960, Peter learned to channel his aggression into soldiering, seeing action in the SAS before fighting as a mercenary in Africa throughout the 10s and 80s.

In 1989, McAleese and his friend Dave Tomkins were hired by a Colombian drug cartel to undertake a mission to kill the world’s biggest cocaine dealer, Pablo Escobar. In Colombia, he gathered a select team of ex-Special Forces operatives and began training for a lightning raid on Escobar’s Hacienda. After 11 weeks of intense preparation, the men launched the operation which ultimately led to disaster and would have a devastating effect on McAleese and others.";Film;BBC SCOTLAND;Contains strong language and some upsetting scenes.;2021;89;films, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09fxtrw.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09fxtrw.jpg;documentary telling incredible true story scottish mercenary peter mcaleese hired kill colombian drug lord pablo escobar 1989 unprecedented access peter member team first full account fateful mission dark consequence involved full access mcaleese ’ personal archive well neverbeforeseen amateur footage operation killing escobar weave material alongside dramatic reconstruction interview mcaleese fellow mercenary also hear one pablo escobar ’ bodyguard member america ’ dea security chief colombian drug cartel wanted escobar eliminated film also provides deeply personal character study peter mcaleese man trained fight kill cost family mcaleese actively sought war conflict admits close paid costly price desire seek adventure mcaleese ’ youth postwar working class glasgow marked poverty violence quickly learned fight leaving glasgow parachute regiment 1960 peter learned channel aggression soldiering seeing action sa fighting mercenary africa throughout 10 80 1989 mcaleese friend dave tomkins hired colombian drug cartel undertake mission kill world ’ biggest cocaine dealer pablo escobar colombia gathered select team exspecial force operative began training lightning raid escobar ’ hacienda 11 week intense preparation men launched operation ultimately led disaster would devastating effect mcaleese others;1

Bitter Lake is an adventurous and epic film by Adam Curtis that explains why the big stories that politicians tell us have become so simplified that we can’t really see the world any longer.

The narrative goes all over the world, America, Britain, Russia and Saudi Arabia - but the country at the heart of it is Afghanistan. Because Afghanistan is the place that has confronted our politicians with the terrible truth - that they cannot understand what is going on any longer. 

The film reveals the forces that over the past thirty years rose up and undermined the confidence of politics to understand the world. And it shows the strange, dark role that Saudi Arabia has played in this.

But Bitter Lake is also experimental. Curtis has taken the unedited rushes of everything that the BBC has ever shot in Afghanistan - and used them in new and radical ways.

The guests were celebrity snapper Ray Bellasario and comedy actor Terry-Thomas. Seen as a temporary ten-week filler programme, it went on to record over 650 episodes featuring interviews with over 2,000 guests and was voted by the BFI one of the top ten UK television programmes of all time.

This programme tells the full story of the humble beginnings of the show and how it rose to become an award-winning Saturday night staple, a source of water-cooler moments before that phrase had even been thought of. It tells the story of how Michael left Fleet Street and stumbled into television at Granada, where he made his first attempt at celebrity interviewing in an encounter with Mick Jagger. Poached by the BBC, he then found himself hosting the show that would make his name, and he recounts how the success of the show was secured by convincing Orson Welles to appear, as well as how the first series was wiped, losing interviews with John Lennon and Yoko Ono amongst others.

It was a time when the likes of Jimmy Cagney, Fred Astaire, Lauren Bacall and Ingrid Bergman could be interviewed in depth for the first time, though the show developed into something more than just a celebrity gabfest. Michael reveals some tricks of the interview trade and remembers some of his favourite moments, including his encounters with Muhammad Ali and Billy Connolly, as well as some less successful meetings with Meg Ryan and Helen Mirren.

You don’t have to own your own home for our stylish yet thrifty interior designer to come knocking. Whinnie Williams is a design queen who dares to be different, and she believes that if housemates clubbed together and rolled their sleeves up, for just the cost of a big night out, you can boujee up your living room and transform it into a sick pad. Whinnie and her co-host Tyler West are passionate about showing that home renovations don’t have to cost a fortune – you can have that million pound look for less. Scouring vintage shops, online auctions and with loads of smart, money saving upcycling ideas and decorating tips, she’s about to share how anyone can do it.

Whinnie and Tyler are in Fulham in London meeting Robin and Jasmin, two housemates that are polar opposites when it comes to taste but love living together. Robin works for a leather company, likes grey tones and the finer things in life, whilst Welsh art teacher Jasmin loves lots of splashes of colour and a vintage bargain. Their living room is a great space but it’s grey and doesn’t reflect either of their creative personalities or how they want to save money renting. They’re hoping Whinnie and Tyler can help make the space their own. Much to his displeasure, Whinnie’s tasked Robin and Tyler with making expanding foam photo frames whilst she and Jasmin design sofa cushions. Robin’s not certain about the powder pink chairs he and Whinnie paint and the lilac walls of the living room. Whinnie’s promising to surprise them with a wavy console table in front of a hand painted patterned wall and a stone effect top shelving unit come desk.

Wayne is renowned for his football skills, but how many household items can he successfully kick into a goal?

Having been victims of the 2008 property crash, Steve and Sarah are financially back on their feet. But with a young family to support, they find they never have money at the end of the month for their savings pot. Keen to replace their kitchen after 14 years, the couple need to rethink their current spending habits in order to give themselves a bit of financial security and some money for home improvements.

However, the couple are relying on store cards and online credit to pay for clothes and household items, as while larger one-off payments are unaffordable, smaller monthly ones seem more manageable. Throw in monthly subscription boxes and regular toy-buying for their two daughters, and these two are spending more than they realise. Melanie and Jo bring Steve and Sarah face to face with the extent of their spending to make them see just where their money is going.

Jo reveals the amount they have spent in the last year just in interest on their store cards and online credit in the hope that they will stop seeing them as an affordable option. Melanie, Sarah and eldest daughter Ellie fire up the barbecue to see whether you really do need to splash out on BBQ tools, and Jo and Steve assemble four football goals in the garden to find out which Steve would choose to buy.

J-House is in Herzliya, a millionaire's playground by the Med. It is a palatial white home tucked away in a suburban plot and reached by a bridge over lush gardens. Piers and Caroline discover luxurious, warm and vibrant interiors that contrast with the modernist facade. Glass walls open up to connect the entire living area with the gardens and pool.

Shutter House sits on a hillside overlooking the Sea of Galilee. It is an elegant, unshowy house, and its subtle colours and materials match the soil and stone of the olive and carob groves. To combat the 40-degree heat, the architects used a traditional system of balconies, breezeways and beautiful wooden screens, which cast light and shadows throughout this peaceful house. Caroline says being here is 'a religious experience.' 

Piers and Caroline's next destination is the historic city of Jerusalem. Barud House is a love poem to Jerusalem stone - named after the warning cry given by quarry workers before detonating explosives. Its facade is made from 50,000 white stone tiles, arranged into a symmetrical pattern that casts shadows across the house all day. Inside Piers and Caroline discover more stone - the rough rock face behind the house has been left exposed and is boldly revealed behind a glass wall. Gleaming white interiors, a swimming pool, games room and big city views enhance the glamour of this striking house.

The final stop is the Arab village of Musmus and the House of Three Gardens. Tel Aviv architect Ron Fleisher has designed a house that combines traditional Islamic architecture with modernism. He has linked existing buildings with a stunning double-height traditional liwan, or entrance hall, and a gleaming white staircase.

In the elegant coastal town of Aberystwyth, Michael visits the National Library of Wales, set high on a hill with views over Cardigan Bay. Michael hears how the idea of a repository for works in the Welsh language and an institution in which to preserve Welsh culture took shape and culminated, in 1937, in this prestigious institution. Michael is fascinated to see William Morgan’s Welsh translation of the Bible, published in 1588.

An unforgettable excursion on the Vale of Rheidol Railway takes Michael on a steep climb to Devil’s Bridge, past spectacular waterfalls and wooded hillsides.

Close by, in the Bwlch Nant yr Arian Forest, Michael heads for a lake, where magnificent birds of prey come to feed. At the time of his Bradshaw’s Guide, the red kite was close to extinction. But Wales’s favourite bird now thrives, and in order to keep it that way, astonishing numbers are fed here daily. Michael dares to lend a hand.

High above Aberystwyth, Michael heads for a hilltop, where during the 1930s, amazing discoveries were made. At Pen Dinas, a young professor from Aberystwyth University dug deep below Roman remains and found an iron age settlement. Michael learns how archaeological methods have changed today.

Michael’s 250-mile tour of north Wales draws to a close in style at the birthplace of the nation’s first classical music festival, Gregynog Hall, near Newtown.

Over 15 million of us spend half our days at a desk, in our cars or on the sofa. It might seem harmless, but over six hours of prolonged sitting increases the risk of obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.

This week’s 'laboratory' is the Humberside Police. Hugh and Steph challenge both the 999 control room and managerial staff to bring more movement into their daily routines, which up until now consist of long shifts sat at their desks.

But if they are cajoling others to live well, then Hugh and Steph feel it’s only fair that they walk the walk themselves. With Steph in a very demanding job, she readily admits she struggles to turn off. Dr Zoe prescribes weekly sessions of forest bathing, which recent scientific studies have proved can cut cortisol levels by up to 15 per cent.

While Hugh is an enthusiastic jogger, like many over the age of 45 he has noticed he is losing his muscle strength. Dr Zoe recommends he tries some simple training exercises to help build up his below-average muscles.

In our image-obsessed world, Steph then meets one family struggling with body image. Mum Sunita may have lost several stone in weight recently, but it hasn’t stopped her from feeling intensely self-conscious, and now she is worried that her daughter Simran might follow in her footsteps. Steph suggests they try life drawing – a recent scientific study found that painting people in the nude can increase self-confidence by 25 per cent. Meanwhile, Hugh wants to test one of the most popular health crazes to hit the market – CBD – on three volunteers suffering from insomnia.

BBC Two was making over homes by chucking out the chintz, turning gardens into outside rooms and kitchens into pukka Jamie Oliver zones. But it didn't stop there. Soon there was a craze for decluttering and minimal living linked to the crazed flipping of homes in the mortgage-mad Noughties. Inevitably, a slew of programmes about buying and selling property, homes in the country and living abroad followed.

The stars of this new era of makeover television, including Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen, Diarmuid Gavin and Charlie Dimmock, are all on hand to try and explain how this bewilderingly fast reinvention of the very idea of home happened - and why it couldn't last.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. Now help is at hand in the Barbershop for Bald Men. We meet Bryan, Matty and Jason. Bryan started losing his hair in his late twenties and believes it has robbed him of the confidence to start dating. Matty started losing his when he was just 18 and went on to have a failed hair transplant a few years later. Jason, who also happens to a barber, despairs at spending his days surrounded by mirrors, working on the very thing he wants most.

Featuring fans including Levison Wood and Ade Adepitan as they reflect on his achievement.;"This special episode sees Michael revisit his fifth travel series – Himalaya.

For Michael, this epic journey across the world’s highest mountain range is the fulfilment of boyhood dreams inspired by the 1953 ascent of Everest by Hillary and Tensing. Beginning in the famous Khyber Pass, he travels through Pakistan and India and ascends into Nepal and Tibet to reach Everest base camp itself, before venturing into the mountain kingdom of Bhutan.

But Michael’s journey isn’t all about scaling peaks – it’s also about finding out what life is like for the people who live in some of the harshest environments on Earth. He is curious to see countries that were cut off by the mountains for centuries and that have developed their own distinct cultures and ways of survival, to discover the different ways that religion influences society here, and to meet the hardy inhabitants of the mountains.

Along the way, Michael sees Pakistan’s historically volatile North West Frontier region and narrowly avoids a bull during a bull-racing festival. Crossing the border into India, he visits the Sikh city of Amritsar and the Golden Temple, where he learns about Sikhism and eats with the thousands of pilgrims who come there. And in Dharamshala, he learns about Buddhism and meets the Dalai Lama – who turns out to be a Palin fan.

Moving ever upwards into the mountains, Michael suffers from altitude sickness, and at one point thinks he might have to give up. But he recovers and is rewarded with stunning views of the Annapurna range. Eventually, he reaches Everest base camp, where he reflects on the achievement of walking in the footsteps not only of Hillary but of the earlier British explorers Mallory and Irvine, who were childhood heroes of his.

Being curious to find out how people live up at high altitude, he spends time with a Nepalese yak-herder and his family, making a real connection despite not speaking their language. In Nagaland, he has a chat with an elderly headhunter, who turns out to be much friendlier than he looks.

When Chris, who had suffered from testicular health scares in the past, appeared on live television to have a testicular examination, it made a huge impact. Chris’s aim was to raise awareness of testicular cancer and encourage men to check themselves. What he didn’t expect was the effect it would have closer to home.

As a consequence of that appearance, and inspired by his brother for having 'had the balls' to do it, Chris’s older brother Ben checked himself for the first time, found a lump and was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Prior to an operation to have his testicle removed, Ben went to freeze his sperm for potential use after the operation. It was during this process that he discovered his sample didn’t contain any sperm at all.

With both boys now concerned about their fertility, they embark on a journey to find out where they stand and what the future holds for them. Aside from their own medical stories, where Chris discovers how his fertility has changed since he was last tested six years earlier and Ben learns about his fertility prospects, the brothers meet a variety of people to explore the wider issues. Chris and Ben chat with their mates down the pub about how little men know about the causes of male infertility. They meet with one of the UK’s leading experts for a step-by-step guide to sperm, learn how infertility affects masculinity from a GB Olympic rower, and consider how their fertility struggles could impact on their family, and their girlfriends, in the long term.";Documentary;BBC THREE;Contains some strong language.;2020;57;lifestyle, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p08sfp59.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p08sfp59.jpg;brother ball intimate personal documentary exploring male fertility love island star chris hughes brother ben chris suffered testicular health scare past appeared live television testicular examination made huge impact chris ’ aim raise awareness testicular cancer encourage men check ’ expect effect would closer home consequence appearance inspired brother ball chris ’ older brother ben checked first time found lump diagnosed testicular cancer prior operation testicle removed ben went freeze sperm potential use operation process discovered sample ’ contain sperm boy concerned fertility embark journey find stand future hold aside medical story chris discovers fertility changed since last tested six year earlier ben learns fertility prospect brother meet variety people explore wider issue chris ben chat mate pub little men know cause male infertility meet one uk ’ leading expert stepbystep guide sperm learn infertility affect masculinity gb olympic rower consider fertility struggle could impact family girlfriend long term;4

A call for a patient stuck in a forest in Cumbria takes priority.;"As crews book on across Lancashire and Cumbria for the sunny Easter bank holiday weekend, an urgent call from the police for backup to help a patient who is walking into the sea on Blackpool beach takes priority. Crewmates Holly and Craig are immediately dispatched, but when they arrive on the scene, he has disappeared. As they begin their search, a fresh 999 call is answered for a patient who has been assaulted by their partner. It doesn’t take long for the team in control to piece together that the call is related to the patient, who has now been found on Blackpool beach.

Meanwhile, a new 999 call is received from a carer who has found a resident on the floor, having been there all night. Crewmates Hannah and Richard are immediately dispatched, and on arrival they are saddened to discover the reasons why the patient didn’t call for help.

Three hours into the shift and already 172 patients are currently being treated across the North West. There are a further 28 patients waiting for an ambulance to arrive but a call for an elderly patient who frequently dials 999 which takes priority, there are fears that this time it isn’t a false alarm and the patient has actually taken an overdose. Crewmates, Holly and Craig arrive on scene to find that the patient does need to be taken to hospital for further assessment. However, when they arrive at the hospital, besides being offered treatment the patient is also served with an ASBO to try to stop her misusing NHS & council services by frequent calling.

As midday approaches, the streets of Blackpool are coming alive with tourists - a sight which hasn’t been seen for over a year. But it isn’t just in the towns that people are going out, a new

999 call for a patient who has come off their bike in the middle of the Cumbrian woodland takes priority. With fears that the patient has suffered multiple injuries, Consultant Paramedic, Vinny is sent to manage the patient care on scene. He faces over an hour long journey to the patient which will see him snake through the Cumbrian fells with a trip on the Lake Windermere ferry in order to reach him. When he arrives it is quickly determined that his condition is serious enough that he will needs the assistance of the mountain rescue team and the air ambulance. Whilst Vinny waits for additional support, in Kendal ambulance crew Matt & Wendy are sent to the aid of another cyclist who has also fallen from their bike.

As the weekend begins to wind to an end, a new shift begins for Holly and Craig, who are dispatched to a familiar patient. It is a woman who frequently rings 999 and who has again claimed to have taken an overdose. It quickly becomes apparent why she has become one the most frequent callers across the whole of the region and just how difficult it is to help her.

Meanwhile, Hannah and Richard are sent to a patient who has been suffering from seizures. When they decide to take the patient to hospital, they must find someone to look after the patient's dog, Teddy. En route to hospital, the patient reveals that she has been struggling to come to terms with the many losses in her life, and it provides a moment of reflection for Hannah, who has also recently suffered the loss of someone close.

Life slowly comes back to normal for the staff of North West Ambulance Service as the country celebrates the Easter bank holiday weekend. It demonstrates that behind the immediate challenges of the pandemic, the ambulance service still has to deal with many intractable issues: domestic violence, an ageing population, loneliness and mental health.

How do you organise a network in a country of separate time zones and no recognised timetables?;"Historian Liz McIvor explores how Britain's expanding rail network was the spark to a social revolution, starting in the 1800s and continuing through to modern times. A fast system of transportation shaped so many areas of our industrial nation - from what we eat to where we live, work and play. The railways generated economic activity but they also changed the nature of business itself. They even changed attitudes to time and how we set our clocks. Our railways may have reflected deep class divisions, but they also brought people together as never before, and helped forge a new sense of national identity. 

This episode looks at how you organise a rail network in a country made up of separate local time zones and no recognised timetables. Before the railways, our country was divided and local time was proudly treasured. Clocks in the west of the country were several minutes behind those set in the east. The railways wanted the country to step to a new beat in a world of precise schedules and timetables that recognised Greenwich Mean Time. Not everyone was keen to step in line, and some complained about the new world of one single time zone and precise schedules.";History;BBC ONE;False;2016;29;lifestyle, history, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p048nkhm.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p048nkhm.jpg;historian liz mcivor explores britain expanding rail network spark social revolution starting 1800s continuing modern time fast system transportation shaped many area industrial nation eat live work play railway generated economic activity also changed nature business even changed attitude time set clock railway may reflected deep class division also brought people together never helped forge new sense national identity episode look organise rail network country made separate local time zone recognised timetable railway country divided local time proudly treasured clock west country several minute behind set east railway wanted country step new beat world precise schedule timetable recognised greenwich mean time everyone keen step line complained new world one single time zone precise schedule;16

The British hastily partitioned British India before they left. Independence was attended by a million deaths and 14 million people were displaced. 

Yet despite three wars, Pakistan and Indian railways have established a cross-border train, known as the Samjhauta Express - Samjhauta meaning agreement.

Amongst the passengers on the Samjhauta Express from Lahore to Delhi are Bilal and his father Abiz. Seventeen-year-old Bilal was the victim of an accident which damaged his eye. Unable to source the right treatment in Pakistan, father and son trawled the internet and finally found a suitable clinic. But it was in India. They have never stepped outside Pakistan, so they are a little nervous. Will they be successful in getting Bilal's eye treated?

Also on the train is Rahat Khan, the hockey queen. She's a Pakistan international and a railway hockey champion. She is travelling with her Pakistan girls' hockey team to play a match in India. But not everything goes to plan.

At Paradise Island, Ade finds an abandoned hotel.;"The final leg of Ade Adepitan’s epic tour of Africa sees him travelling from the beaches of Mozambique, through South Africa, before ending his entire trip in Zimbabwe.

He begins on the golden sand beaches of Mozambique’s Bazaruto Archipelago, one of Africa’s highlights. At Paradise Island, he finds an abandoned hotel, a visual reminder of Mozambique’s recent history - this place was once a high-end tourist destination, but 25 years of colonial and then civil war put a stop to development. But the local wildlife has benefited from the fact that so few tourists now come here, and Ade is able to snorkel with one of the world’s most elusive sea creatures - a dugong.

Since the wars, Mozambique has struggled to develop, and Ade meets someone for whom life is especially hard – a wheelchair user like himself. In a country where disability is viewed with fear and superstition – and believed by many to be contagious – even catching a bus proves impossible for Castigo. The best thing in his life is exactly the same thing that turned Ade’s life around - wheelchair basketball - and Ade can’t help getting carried away in a game. Along the coast, at one of Mozambique’s largest ports, Ade finds out that China is investing a huge amount in Mozambique – and elsewhere across Africa. The money often comes with strings attached, but a poor country like Mozambique needs financial help, which has to come from somewhere. 

Ade’s next stop is South Africa. The country is famous for its wildlife but Ade hears how Chinese influence is having a dramatic impact here – the country’s rhino population has been decimated by poachers, driven by a demand for rhino horn in Chinese medicine. Ade follows rangers with a surprising way of tackling the problem - by cutting off the rhino horn themselves, they hope to deter poachers.

Ade travels to Johannesburg to see how the country is faring 25 years after apartheid ended. On a tour of the city, he is upset to discover that although the black population now have voting rights, they are living in an economic form of apartheid, with 25% unemployed and many squatting on whatever land they can find. In an emotional scene, Ade visits a squatted piece of land, moments after the police have destroyed people’s houses, to hear claims that Mandela’s legacy has been forgotten. Land reform is the big political issue here today, with many calling for a redistribution of land from rich white farmers to the black population.

The final stop on Ade’s African adventure is Zimbabwe – where land reform has already happened, with disastrous results. Ade finds a country still struggling economically. His first stop is the Kariba dam, and a hair-raising boat ride on the vast and stunning Lake Kariba. Ade finds that locals are worried about the stability of the Kariba dam and work has begun to stabilize undermined foundations. The worrying decay of this crucial dam is a sign of how much this country suffered under the rule of Robert Mugabe.

As Ade has seen so often on his trip around Africa, Zimbabwe is a country that should be rich. It has huge quantities of gold – enough, in theory, for the entire population to be a millionaire. But there isn’t the infrastructure of investment to get at it - in a country dogged by poverty and corruption. But the departure of dictator Robert Mugabe brought a new optimism, and Ade meets gold miners who are willing to risk daily exposure to toxic mercury for every scrap of gold they can get and an entrepreneur who believes the industry can be transformed. Despite the return of violence and repression in Zimbabwe, Ade ends his journey on a high, visiting a remote hut that has been turned into the set of a music video.

On the beautiful and uninhabited St Ninian’s Isle, he contemplates those in the distant past who sought out remote spots for quiet contemplation. And he visits the Isle of Oxna with a father and daughter whose ancestors once lived there.

Andy and Sabina Holt moved from a hippy lifestyle to live on the island of Papa Stour 48 years ago. Sabina then had what she calls 'a marvellous encounter' with Jesus, and the two have been living as committed Christians since. Ben discusses the effect living somewhere as remote and beautiful as this has on their faith.

Ben also meets crofter Vic Thomas, who shares his belief in the life cycles of birth, growth and death, and their spiritual meaning in a place where Mother Nature is so much in evidence.

Ben catches up with Shetland chef Akshay Borges, a champion of the island’s ‘sea harvest’. Akshay arrived from Goa in 2011, a life-changing decision he made on the flip of a coin.

Travelling to the Isle of Yell, Ben visits a chicken shed converted into one of the UK’s smallest chapels. Its keeper, Anne Dobbing, explains that Shetland’s many Christian denominations seem to blend into one, as if the remote wildness forges a common spirituality.

Two years ago a close friend died and it affected her hugely. The grief triggered an attack of acne, which she never struggled with before. She’s been left with scarring that makes her extremely self-conscious. Convinced that people are staring at her skin, Katia has always shied away from finding love and has never been on a date. 

In the salon, Sophia finds out that Katia cuts her mousy blonde hair herself and hides in oversized coats. When she lost her friend she lost her self-esteem, and now two years later she wants to press the re-set button. With Katia’s dream hair colours as oranges and reds, Sophia’s vision for her make-over is a bright orange style, a bold cut to enhance her fringe and clothes to really get her noticed.

As Twinks talks all things fashion, we learn that Katia has a love of monochrome and bohemian style dresses but has never had the courage to wear anything bold or bright before. As Katia never wears make-up, MUA Bernicia shows Katia how to not let her skin hold her back by giving her a flawless base.

Weve Got This;The experiment is ending and Tom discovers if his families are now healthier and happier.;In the last part of his experiment, Tom gets the families to cook bigger dishes than ever before and tests whether they are healthier and happier than 12 weeks ago.;"The eight families who are following Tom Kerridge's Fresh Start plan have risen to every challenge he has set them, transforming mealtimes at home. Now, as the experiment draws to a close, they're coming together to celebrate their achievements - and to take on Tom's final challenge: cooking generous dishes for groups of friends and family.

Tom kicks things off by cooking beef biryani for his own extended family. With a one-pot wonder like this, the most important thing is to pack in tons of flavour. Tom roasts the mince for the biryani in the oven to maximise the flavour before adding it to the pot. He doesn't hold back on the ginger, garlic and spices either. The finished dish contains around half the calories of a standard takeaway curry and has loads of veg thrown in so there's no need for extra side dishes. 

The Johnson family love hosting parties but are unhappy about the food they usually offer their guests; frozen pizzas and tinned hot dogs were the norm.   Now they are throwing their first party since starting Tom's experiment. It's Mum Becky's 40th birthday and they want to serve real, homemade party food. Tom and the Johnsons - including three sons - work as a team to prepare chicken ranch burgers for 20 hungry guests. The recipe can be prepped ahead so the Johnsons have more time to relax and celebrate when friends and family arrive.

Over the last two and a half months, the gang have learnt loads of new cooking techniques.  Now Tom wants them to use what they've learnt to be even more ambitious.  He is challenging them to make bigger dishes for more people than ever before - to show how delicious food has the power to bring people together. Back in his kitchen, Tom makes a sumptuous chicken, ham and leek Pie - perfect for a large group to share, hot or cold. This is exactly the sort of dish that can transform how Tom's gang cook for their friends and family. 

To mark the end of the experiment and celebrate their achievements, all the families are getting together for a picnic in a few days' time. Tom has asked them all to cook a dish they can bring along and share with the group. And Tom's not going to arrive empty handed either; he's doing his own version of Eton mess, a summer pudding that both kids and adults love. Meringues from scratch and a simple strawberry coulis are things all of us can make - other than that there's not much 'cooking'. This is a dish with lots of separate elements that taste incredible when combined and it's ideal for a summer party.

Meanwhile Tom asks each family to come up with a resolution to take forward now that the experiment is coming to an end; a pledge that's personal to their own experience and will help keep their cooking and eating on track in the months and years ahead. He also asks the gang to take the same set of health and fitness tests as they did at the start, to find out how much progress they've made.

The final day of the experiment comes around and all the Fresh Start gang gather together for a picnic and cricket match. Twelve weeks on they've come a long way - they're all cooking from scratch, eating healthier meals and, importantly, eating together as a family more often. Tom reveals the results of the recent health tests and there's plenty to celebrate; from weight loss and improved fitness to greater happiness. And the families reveal their new resolutions and share the incredible food they've all made.

Cooking and eating together has brought so many positive changes to the lives of these eight families.

In this family home, they’ve converted a garage full of stuff to create an annex for Nan and Grandad, but as a result the clutter has now taken over the rest of the house.

With Stacey’s help, the family start packing all their possessions into boxes. Every single item is stripped from the family home revealing how much space there is under all their things. We get to know the family behind the clutter – working mum Kelly, policeman Dan and their two daughters – and why their house is making them miserable. 

With the house all packed up, the family’s possessions are laid out in a giant warehouse like an art installation of their entire lives; including 107 boardgames, 640 old CDs and hundreds of odd socks. With everything displayed in front of them, the family are shocked to see how much they really own and how it all fitted into their house in the first place.

There are emotional moments in the warehouse as the family try let go of baby items they’ve held on to, and tensions rise as the sheer enormity of the task takes its toll.
 
The items they do decide to let go of will be put into piles to recycle, donate or sell.   

At the house, carpenter Rob breathes new life into the home by creating a multi-purpose spare room and transforming the office into a workspace of dreams. Cleaner Iwan gives the home a supersize spring clean, with lots of useful tips along the way, and organizer Dilly shows us all the best way to organise our paperwork.

When the family are left with only the must keep items, they are packed back up to the house before it’s stylishly refilled by Stacey and her team, ready for the big reveal to the family.

In this fifth leg, Simon travels across Central America from the Caribbean to the Pacific.;"Simon Reeve continues his journey through the Americas. In this fifth leg of the journey, Simon travels across Central America from the Caribbean to the Pacific. He begins by diving on a coral reef on the coast of northern Belize and visits a rescue centre for orphaned manatees. In Belize’s Chiquibul National Park, Simon witnesses a gun battle between armed park rangers and intruders from neighbouring Guatemala intent on clearing the rainforest for farming. 

Simon's next stop is Guatemala, where over half the population live off the land. The staple crop is corn, but Simon discovers that a vast area of Central America is suffering from a severe drought, partly blamed on climate change. Half of children under the age of five are malnourished, and Simon visits one mother who only has eight days of food left to feed her young family. The drought is not only causing hunger but mass migration to the United States. 

In El Salvador Simon encounters the other big factor in the migration crisis: the brutal gang violence that causes thousands to flee the country. A new government in El Salvador is cracking down on the gangs, and Simon heads out on patrol with an elite police unit tasked with taking back control of the streets. In a dark situation, Simon finds a ray of light in a volunteer organisation that takes young teenagers from gang neighbourhoods and trains them to be paramedics. 

The last destination on this leg of the journey is Costa Rica, a small tropical paradise that's home to 6% of the world's biodiversity. In a troubled region, Costa Rica is a beacon of hope and stability. It has led the world in eco-tourism and aims to become the first carbon neutral country in 2021.

In seeking answers, he is shocked to discover the true extent of the problem.;"After the sudden and unexplained death of his 19-year-old sister Lauren, Patrick is left grieving, struggling to understand how a young person could go to sleep and never wake up. Every year over 600 young and seemingly healthy people die suddenly and unexpectedly from sudden cardiac death. Lauren's death was registered as SADS, or sudden adult death syndrome, a cause of cardiac death even the experts don’t completely understand.

Patrick finds himself unable to talk to his friends or family, but he needs answers. What could have been done to prevent Lauren’s death, and is there a way to stop other young people dying this way? He and his family are referred to St George’s Hospital in Tooting to undergo cardiac tests in hope of understanding what happened to Lauren. He learns that he, too, could be at risk, as in nearly half of SADS cases, a problem is also detected in other family members.

Patrick also attends a bereavement counselling session in London with other young people who have lost a sibling to SADS. Among them is Tash, who lost her brother when he suffered a cardiac arrest at the wheel of a car, and Ellen, whose brother - a semi-professional rugby player - died following a workout at the gym. Patrick discovers that sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of death in young athletes during exercise. He visits Tonbridge Angels Football Club in Kent, who lost three of their players to sudden death and instigated a screening programme as a result. Here he learns that mandatory screening of athletes in Italy has reduced sudden cardiac death by nearly 90 per cent.

Footballer Fabrice Muamba famously survived SADS after collapsing halfway through a match at White Hart Lane. He and Patrick retrace Fabrice’s steps, as Fabrice tells Patrick how it felt when his heart stopped for 78 minutes.

Finally, Patrick meets a leading cardiac pathologist, Professor Mary Sheppard, who believes SADS deaths are under-reported.

The result is a powerful new documentary showing life in critical care as the virus threatens to overwhelm the NHS.

The Intensive Care teams are on the frontline in the battle against coronavirus, and we see the emotional impact their work has on them – as well as the gratitude they feel for the public support. The film shows the staff working tirelessly to triple the unit’s bed capacity, the struggles coping with PPE and the toll the epidemic takes on family life.

This unique documentary, filmed entirely by NHS staff, presents an extraordinary personal insight into hospital life during the most serious public health crisis in living memory.

Produced by the BAFTA Cymru-award-winning team behind Critical: Inside Intensive Care, the 60-minute documentary for BBC One Wales follows the lives of medical staff during the four weeks from the time the lockdown came into force, until the number of cases begins to level off in late April. 

Filmed on mobile phones and small cameras, the film captures life at the sharp end of the fight against the virus, as the dedicated medical staff struggle to contain the outbreak. The Aneurin Bevan Health Board that covers Newport and the Gwent Valleys emerged as one of the UK’s coronavirus hotspots, with more cases than anywhere outside London, per head of population.

Wales has fewer intensive care beds than anywhere else in Britain. This, alongside an aging population, long-standing social problems and close proximity to the urban populations of England, meant  that the Gwent outbreak was one of the most serious in Britain. 

Intensive Care Consultant Dr David Hepburn recovered from coronavirus to return to work on the unit. He says in the film: ‘There’s a huge variation in the demographic, but traditionally this has been an area of high social deprivation and particular health problems, and Newport is known for seeing more extreme pathology than in some of the more metropolitan areas like Cardiff, so not a desperately healthy population. But at the minute, we are at the epicentre of this outbreak, outside the big metropolitan areas of London and Birmingham.’ 

‘Per head of population, we are seeing more people in Newport who are desperately unwell than most areas and certainly than anywhere else in Wales.’

Emotional video diaries show doctors and nurses leaving their families to come into work to find the unit full of patients on ventilators. It shows the challenges of communicating with colleagues in full PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and the heartbreak of having to tell relatives over the phone that their loved ones have died, as the hospital is closed to visitors.

It shows the extraordinary outpouring of public support for NHS staff, with gifts of food and drink sent to the unit and the reaction of staff the Thursday night Clap for Carers. We see how the staff work together to keep morale high under incredibly traumatic circumstances.

Intensive Care Consultant Dr Laura McClelland speaks of her hope for the future: ‘From a personal perspective, as much as the lockdown has been difficult, it’s been quite a period of reflection and prioritisation.

870;870;Travelling Blind;None;Blind traveller Amar Latif sets off to explore Turkey with comedian Sara Pascoe.;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p07k2vk6.jpg;BBC, iPlayer, TV, Travelling Blind;Blind traveller Amar Latif sets off to explore Turkey with comedian Sara Pascoe.;Blind traveller Amar Latif sets off to explore Turkey with the comedian Sara Pascoe as his sighted guide.;"Amar Latif was told, aged four, that he would be blind by the time he was 18. However, his lack of sight hasn’t prevented him from experiencing the world. He has travelled extensively, visiting over a hundred countries and taken up skydiving, bungee jumping and skiing. Whenever Amar travels he relies on someone sighted to guide him. In return he opens their eyes and all their senses to a completely different way of travelling.   

Amar is joined by comedian Sara Pascoe as he attempts to open her eyes to the potential of travelling blind and ‘seeing’ the world differently. The destination is Turkey and their journey takes them off the beaten track as they explore the country’s bustling cities, remote mountains and extra-ordinary landscapes. What becomes clear is that Sara and Amar travel in completely different ways. Sara prefers to stand back and observe while Amar needs to be in the thick of things. Their journey through Turkey becomes as much about their relationship with each other, as it is about the country.  

Amar and Sara start their travels in Istanbul and as they navigate the city’s vast Grand Bazaar to get to their hotel, Sara is keen to guide them straight there but Amar just wants to smell, listen and touch every item in the bazaar. It is Sara’s first lesson in guiding - if you are blind then things need to be experienced, or else they don’t really exist.  

After three days in Istanbul, Amar and Sara head east to the mountains along the Black Sea. Traditional communities still live here and have a long history of summer festivities. One of these is oil wrestling – a sport Amar has heard about but never witnessed. Sara must describe the complexities of large men in leather trousers covering themselves in olive oil and throwing each other onto the ground and she rises to the challenge.  

Their time in the mountains also gives Amar and Sara time to understand each other better. Amar opens up of how he went blind, and the impact it had one his teenage life. By 18, he had lost his sight completely and found himself trapped in darkness, just as his friends were getting girlfriends and exploring the world. Amar overcame his depression by deciding to say yes to everything and becoming an immensely positive person.  

However, after 25 years of blindness, Amar is now beginning to forget what things look like. Images that were once familiar in his imagination - clouds, birds, his mother’s face - are fading.  Sara is deeply affected by this and decides to take Amar to a place that is unlike anywhere he has been before. And she plans to describe it so well that it creates a new visual palate in his imagination. They head to Cappadocia, a unique landscape formed from volcanic mud that has been eroded to create staggering rock formations. For 24 hours, Sara describes the scene in forensic detail to the extent that Amar can picture it in his mind and ‘see again’. By the end of their transformational journey they have both learnt a huge amount from each other and how we interact with the world around us.";Documentary;BBC TWO;False;2019;59;lifestyle, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p07k2vk6.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07k2vk6.jpg;amar latif told aged four would blind time 18 however lack sight ’ prevented experiencing world travelled extensively visiting hundred country taken skydiving bungee jumping skiing whenever amar travel relies someone sighted guide return open eye sens completely different way travelling amar joined comedian sara pascoe attempt open eye potential travelling blind ‘ seeing ’ world differently destination turkey journey take beaten track explore country ’ bustling city remote mountain extraordinary landscape becomes clear sara amar travel completely different way sara prefers stand back observe amar need thick thing journey turkey becomes much relationship country amar sara start travel istanbul navigate city ’ vast grand bazaar get hotel sara keen guide straight amar want smell listen touch every item bazaar sara ’ first lesson guiding blind thing need experienced else ’ really exist three day istanbul amar sara head east mountain along black sea traditional community still live long history summer festivity one oil wrestling – sport amar heard never witnessed sara must describe complexity large men leather trouser covering olive oil throwing onto ground rise challenge time mountain also give amar sara time understand better amar open went blind impact one teenage life 18 lost sight completely found trapped darkness friend getting girlfriend exploring world amar overcame depression deciding say yes everything becoming immensely positive person however 25 year blindness amar beginning forget thing look like image familiar imagination cloud bird mother ’ face fading sara deeply affected decides take amar place unlike anywhere plan describe well creates new visual palate imagination head cappadocia unique landscape formed volcanic mud eroded create staggering rock formation 24 hour sara describes scene forensic detail extent amar picture mind ‘ see ’ end transformational journey learnt huge amount interact world around u;9

Without them the NHS would have been in danger of collapse - not least during the current COVID crisis - but from the very start the story of this beloved British institution has been intertwined with one of the most divisive social and political issue of the age, immigration. The people who came to this country to work in the NHS have found themselves fighting battles they neither sought nor expected.

Today, more than 13 per cent of the 1.2 million people who work for the NHS are from overseas, representing 200 different nationalities, and in England and Wales more than 40 per cent can claim minority ethnic heritage, making the NHS the most diverse of all British institutions. The programme gives voice to the moving and often raw experiences of nurses from the Irish Republic, the Caribbean and the Philippines, GPs and surgeons from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka and paramedics from Central Europe, as well as to the British-born children and grandchildren of immigrants who have found themselves helping and healing with one hand while fending off the sharp end of discrimination and racism with the other.

Researchers suggest that as many as 100,000 Botox injections are carried out each year in the UK, and campaigners report an astonishing trebling in botched treatments since 2016.

Ellie's investigation takes her all over the UK to visit beauticians who - she discovers - are happy to give her Botox without her having a valid prescription. She has to tread a very fine line to avoid her cover being blown. Some of these beauticians may be connected, and Ellie has to artfully excuse herself during every appointment to avoid the possibility of being injected unlawfully with Botox.

Ellie attends a legitimate Botox Party in Windsor, where the guests receive Botox treatments along with their snacks, party soundtrack and non-alcoholic champagne. She talks to women in their twenties to find out if Botox really is as essential as getting your nails and hair done.

But, as Ellie finds out, like any medical procedure there are risks and side effects, and getting Botox properly prescribed by a medic after a face to face consultation is important. She speaks to someone who was left physically disfigured and unable to speak, eat or drink as a result of

Ashley John-Baptiste hears from those whose lives have been changed forever.;"Ashley John-Baptiste is a BBC reporter who grew up in foster care and spent most of his life believing he was an only child. That is until his mid-20s, when he received a life-changing message. A man contacted him on social media telling him that he was his brother. 

As it was with Ashley, some children in care grow up completely unaware of their siblings. More common, however, are cases where looked-after children do know about their siblings – but are split up once in care. The law says they should stay together if it's safe and appropriate to do so, but around half of sibling groups in care in the UK are separated.

To find out why this is happening, Ashley hears from young people and children whose lives have been changed forever by the impact of separation.

In Derby, the director of children's social care explains to Ashley that councils are ‘close to the bone’ and allows him to join a new rapid response team that's just supported a family and sibling group to stay together. Amidst a shortage of foster carers, Ashley seeks advice from Debbie Bright from The Only Way Is Essex. She has looked after more than 200 children in 30 years and introduces Ashley to 23-year-old Bryleigh, who has recently become a foster carer herself.

A new law is Scotland is giving brothers and sisters in care more rights over their relationships than ever before. Ashley meets foster carer Karen in Fife, who has been instrumental in the changes and runs a farm where split-up siblings can come to rebuild their bonds. 

For the first time ever, cameras are allowed to capture the reunion of five siblings who are living separated and only see each other two hours every two months.

Hemal and Kapila also yearn for a welcoming home where sisters, aunts, cousins and grandparents can congregate in comfort. But all of this seems like a distant dream.

With barely any storage space, all food and drinks are kept in a cold and damp lean-to which is so cold they often put a coat on to go in. Their home is office is also causing problems, as it’s two floors up in the attic, which separates them from family life.

But behind the scenes Nadiya suffers from extreme anxiety and debilitating panic attacks, which she’s had since childhood. For decades, she has kept her anxiety a secret, ashamed to speak out. 
 
She’s never had a proper diagnosis but thinks she has an anxiety disorder, and with around 5 million people suffering from the condition in the UK, Nadiya is not alone.
 
In this one-off documentary for BBC One, Nadiya sets out to find the cause of her anxiety, exploring the most effective, available treatments, whilst having therapy herself, in the hope of managing her anxiety.
 
She speaks bravely and honestly about what it’s like to live with anxiety and panic attacks; undergoing a course of cognitive behaviour therapy, each session is a step into the unknown. At times, it’s a difficult process, revealing buried memories and key moments from her past. These sessions are raw and honest, but Nadiya hopes her openness will inspire others to seek help rather than suffer in silence.
 
She wants to understand how anxiety is affecting the nation’s health, meeting fellow sufferers in the hope of understanding her own issues.

Breast Reduction;Four women watch live breast reduction surgery as they consider going under the knife.;"Vogue Williams and Mobeen Azhar help four women decide if breast reduction surgery is what they really want by watching live surgery and
meeting former patients.";"Breast reduction surgery is explored on Plastic Surgery Undressed.

It’s the second most popular surgery for women in the UK, and many argue there is nothing cosmetic about it. Bad backs and unwanted attention are just two of the problems faced by those with big boobs.

In an exclusive poll of 18-30-year-olds for the BBC, 65% of respondents said a desire to look ‘normal’ led them to consider a cosmetic procedure. It’s something Eden can relate to, as the size of her boobs made her feel out of place at school. Lauren’s breasts not only give her physical pain, but they affect what she is able to do with her children.

Michaela’s partner loves her breasts, but Michaela’s not a fan. From men fixating on her bust to the women who think it’s OK to grab her breasts in public, Michaela is ready to pay for her surgery. Carla thinks women with large breasts are perceived differently, and with a big birthday coming up she’s hoping family and friends will help her raise the cash to change hers. 

Downsizing breasts while maintaining function and the shape women want is a complex surgery, as top surgeon Amir Nakhdjevani reveals live when he takes his patient Rosie from a HH cup size down to a DD.

With the breast deconstructed first, the women start to question their surgery choices, but it’s the experiences of former patients that have the biggest impact.

Now, in this shocking, moving film, writer, actor and presenter Cerrie Burnell is going to uncover the hidden story of how disabled people fought back – and won their freedom.

Cerrie was born without the lower part of her right arm. As a presenter on CBeebies, Cerrie was astonished to learn that some viewers thought her appearance would scare watching children. Now, she wants to find out where these attitudes to disabled people come from and why they persist today.

She discovers how our modern attitudes to disabled people were first formed in the workhouses of Victorian Britain, uncovers the original records of an institution created to segregate disabled people and stop them having children, and traces the hidden lives of those confined to institutions for their whole lives.

Cerrie hears astonishing stories of heartbreak and cruelty. But she also meets some pioneers who changed the lives of disabled people forever. John Evans was one of the very first to move from a residential home into a one of his own, and Alia Hassan brought the streets of London to a standstill as part of a campaign fighting for disabled people to be allowed to get on a bus.

Ultimately Cerrie discovers that although much has changed for disabled people in Britain today, the battle is not yet won.

He also confronts some harsh realities – the effects of war, the migrant crisis and the rise of militant Islam. From Gibraltar, Michael looks across the Mediterranean to what is for him a mysterious land – north Africa.

Arriving in Fez, Morocco, Michael finds himself immersed in an ancient city that seems to hark back to biblical times. Then, it is across the Atlas Mountains to confront the great desert itself. Here, Michael encounters the more modern reality of this land in the Smara refugee camp, home to displaced people from western Sahara. Then he sets his sights on one of the most alluring destinations of all - Timbuktu, the city that has fascinated so many travellers down the centuries. It is a challenging trip, but Michael makes it, and while the reality of the place doesn’t quite match his image, he learns about its extraordinary history and culture.

Further on, an encounter with a tribe nearly ends in disaster when a gun goes off in Michael’s face.

919;919;Why Is Covid Killing People of Colour?;None;David Harewood investigates the reasons behind health inequality in modern Britain.;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p097wnhs.jpg;BBC, iPlayer, TV, Why Is Covid Killing People of Colour?;David Harewood investigates the reasons behind health inequality in modern Britain.;David Harewood investigates what the high Covid-19 death rates in black and minority ethnic patients reveal about health inequality in modern Britain.;"At the age of 23, actor David Harewood had a psychotic breakdown, a condition he later discovered was far more likely to affect black men. After the shocking news broke that black, Asian and minority ethnic patients were dying in disproportionate numbers from Covid-19, David felt compelled to discover the reasons why. 

David starts his journey in Brent, north west London. During the first wave of the pandemic, the borough had the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in the country. It is also one of the UK's most diverse areas, where nearly 65 per cent of the local population are black, Asian or from other minority ethnic groups. 

He visits Dr Tariq Husain, head of the Intensive Care Unit at the nearby Northwick Park Hospital, who describes the tidal wave of cases that overwhelmed their capacity, five times more than the usual rates of admissions, and the fact that people from minority communities seemed to be the hardest hit. 

Was this just an isolated incident? To find out, David visits Dr Guddi Singh, a paediatric doctor and health expert, who reveals that what happened in Brent is mirrored across the country. Staggeringly, as a black man, David is nearly three times more likely to die from Covid-19. What is it about being black that puts David at such an increased risk? Dr Singh explains that a big risk factor is the job that you do. Key workers risk their lives, exposing themselves to the virus as they keep the country running.

Yet people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are more likely to do these jobs. David visits Tamira, whose father was one of the first members of NHS staff to die from Covid-19. She believes not enough was done to protect him at work. A heart-wrenching but all too common story. 

But why do so many people from minority communities do these frontline jobs? David visits his sister Sandra in Birmingham, where they both grew up. They discuss their parents’ experiences as new migrants to the UK in the 50s, and how your skin colour still impacts your chances of getting a job you want. This discrimination keeps whole sections of society at the bottom of the ladder, a process known as systemic racism. 

Moving on from how people catch Covid-19, David visits Dr Marina Soltan, a respiratory doctor whose research shows that patients with chronic conditions such as hypertension or kidney disease are nearly twice as likely to die from Covid-19, and that many patients with these conditions come from deprived areas. 

But how can where you live affect your health? Not just in terms of Covid-19 but a range of other diseases? David meets Andrew Grieve, an air quality expert from Kings College London, who reveals how air pollution can harm every organ in your body, and that the lower your household income is, the greater your exposure to air pollution.

The consequences of this can be devastating. Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah lost her nine-year-old daughter Ella in 2013 to a fatal asthma attack. After discovering that Ella’s most severe attacks coincided with local spikes in pollution, she began campaigning to get air pollution listed as a cause of her daughter’s death. In a landmark ruling in December 2020, the coroner found in her favour, the first time ever that air quality has been acknowledged as a cause of death in the UK.

It is becoming increasingly clear to David that deprivation can have a huge impact on health, and that people of colour are proportionately more likely to live in deprived conditions. But are environmental factors the only explanation for this disparity? Academic Dr Jenny Douglas shares research that black women are five times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts, and that many of the women she has interviewed for her research felt their concerns were not listened to by health professionals.

David is gradually moving to the unhappy conclusion that systemic racism, be it conscious or unconscious, could be contributing to poorer health outcomes. But a radical theory developed by American professor Arline Geronimus suggests that living with racism can actually have a physiological impact on the body, meaning that black patients age faster and suffer from poor health much earlier - a process she calls 'weathering'. It is a shocking revelation.

Convinced that if there is to be an improvement in the health outcomes for black patients, the role racism plays needs to be acknowledged, David interviews Kemi Badenoch, the government’s minister for equalities. He wants to know why she has dismissed the idea racism might have played a role in putting black and minority ethnic communities at risk from Covid-19. 

He ends his journey frustrated but with some hope. The stark inequalities exposed by Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement have come together at a pivotal time, one he believes can be a moment of change.";Documentary;BBC ONE;False;2021;59;lifestyle, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p097wnhs.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p097wnhs.jpg;age 23 actor david harewood psychotic breakdown condition later discovered far likely affect black men shocking news broke black asian minority ethnic patient dying disproportionate number covid19 david felt compelled discover reason david start journey brent north west london first wave pandemic borough highest covid19 mortality rate country also one uk diverse area nearly 65 per cent local population black asian minority ethnic group visit dr tariq husain head intensive care unit nearby northwick park hospital describes tidal wave case overwhelmed capacity five time usual rate admission fact people minority community seemed hardest hit isolated incident find david visit dr guddi singh paediatric doctor health expert reveals happened brent mirrored across country staggeringly black man david nearly three time likely die covid19 black put david increased risk dr singh explains big risk factor job key worker risk life exposing virus keep country running yet people black minority ethnic background likely job david visit tamira whose father one first member nh staff die covid19 belief enough done protect work heartwrenching common story many people minority community frontline job david visit sister sandra birmingham grew discus parent ’ experience new migrant uk 50 skin colour still impact chance getting job want discrimination keep whole section society bottom ladder process known systemic racism moving people catch covid19 david visit dr marina soltan respiratory doctor whose research show patient chronic condition hypertension kidney disease nearly twice likely die covid19 many patient condition come deprived area live affect health term covid19 range disease david meet andrew grieve air quality expert king college london reveals air pollution harm every organ body lower household income greater exposure air pollution consequence devastating rosamund adookissidebrah lost nineyearold daughter ella 2013 fatal asthma attack discovering ella ’ severe attack coincided local spike pollution began campaigning get air pollution listed cause daughter ’ death landmark ruling december 2020 coroner found favour first time ever air quality acknowledged cause death uk becoming increasingly clear david deprivation huge impact health people colour proportionately likely live deprived condition environmental factor explanation disparity academic dr jenny douglas share research black woman five time likely die pregnancy childbirth white counterpart many woman interviewed research felt concern listened health professional david gradually moving unhappy conclusion systemic racism conscious unconscious could contributing poorer health outcome radical theory developed american professor arline geronimus suggests living racism actually physiological impact body meaning black patient age faster suffer poor health much earlier process call weathering shocking revelation convinced improvement health outcome black patient role racism play need acknowledged david interview kemi badenoch government ’ minister equality want know dismissed idea racism might played role putting black minority ethnic community risk covid19 end journey frustrated hope stark inequality exposed covid19 black life matter movement come together pivotal time one belief moment change;1

The advantage of knowing you are going to die, she tells Miriam, is that you have time to prepare for death. Miriam helps Tracy plan her wake and meets her daughter Mathilda, 19. Part of Tracy’s preparations include trying to lessen the impact her death will have on Mathilda, so for the past six months Tracy has recorded a series of personal messages and irreplaceable life advice for Mathilda to follow when she is gone. Tracy’s frank and forthright approach to dealing with cancer strikes a chord with Miriam, who is keen to meet people who can talk about the reality of dying without sugar-coating the pill. 

Tracy’s openness offers up some surprising and comforting thoughts for Miriam. If you are going to try and prepare for death, she concludes, maybe it helps to take matters in to your own hands? In Hastings, Miriam hooks up with celebrants Kate and Kate who run Coffin Club, a monthly meet-up for people seeking emotional and practical support for all things death related, including building and decorating their own coffins. Within minutes Miriam is slotting her own flat pack coffin together and painting her unique design on the lid. 

Getting to grips with death helps Miriam realise that our end of days doesn’t have to be as scary as she feared, but for some people confronting the terrors of dying requires more extreme measures. In San Francisco, Miriam accompanies Carolyn to the doctors. Following the sudden death of her partner, for the last six months Carolyn has undergone a controversial treatment using psychedelic drugs to help overcome her fear of dying. Dr Phil Wolfson, a pioneer in hallucinogenic psychotherapy, has been treating her end of life anxiety with the horse tranquiliser and recreational party drug ketamine. Illegal unless administered by a doctor, Dr Phil believes that whilst under the influence of the drug, Carolyn’s mind can be transported and her anxieties reduced. Having seen Carolyn’s fears diffused, Miriam starts to wonder if ketamine might be a way to focus less on her ego and instead trust that everything will be fine when she dies with her body and soul melding back in to the cosmos. But preparing for death also means having to accept none of us know when it will come. For some people end of life plans involve more than just building your own coffin and choosing sandwich fillings. Some want to choose when and how they go.

In Amsterdam, Miriam meets Dr Death, aka maverick doctor Philip Nitschke. He runs the controversial right to die movement Exit International, which campaigns for all rational people over 50 to have the right to end their lives peacefully at a time of their choosing. Although assisted suicide is legal in the Netherlands it requires convincing a doctor of the necessity. In his laboratory, Dr Nitschke demos his latest invention for Miriam - a prototype suicide pod called a Sarco. Witnessing the sarcophagus-style tank fill up with deadly nitrogen, Miriam hears his plans to roll out his invention to willing members of the general public within the next two years, with hopes that his machine will be the perfect, peaceful way for people to take control of their deaths.

Although an intellectual supporter of the idea of assisted suicide, Miriam worries Dr Nitschke’s vision might be cheapening life and make death too easy. Going along to one of his workshops, she talks to those attending; from people with painful terminal illnesses to others who just want the choice to opt out. They are not not anti-life, they tell her, they are just anti-life at any price. 

But what about people who shouldn’t be thinking about the end of their life at all? Tyreese, in Telford, is an 18-year-old rapper with bowel and liver cancer. He is determinedly not thinking about ending his life or even preparing for death. He is choosing to fight it. Miriam recites a heartfelt rap Tyreese has written about his illness. Despite his optimism she worries that death maybe too big even for him to control. As an aspiring footballer before he became ill, Tyreese takes Miriam to watch a local game where she realises that it is Tyreese’s positivity that allows him to cling on to hope.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains some strong language.;2019;59;lifestyle, signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p07k00cj.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07k00cj.jpg;actress miriam margolyes 77 death busy hoovering contemporary already met people say reject death choice confront concluding episode compelling documentary series inimitable actress miriam want know ever ready meet death face face head west coast scotland meet tracy two year ago working deputy head teacher oxford discovered terminal ovarian cancer decided move remote island bute live rest life wanted 60 month live advantage knowing going die tell miriam time prepare death miriam help tracy plan wake meet daughter mathilda 19 part tracy ’ preparation include trying lessen impact death mathilda past six month tracy recorded series personal message irreplaceable life advice mathilda follow gone tracy ’ frank forthright approach dealing cancer strike chord miriam keen meet people talk reality dying without sugarcoating pill tracy ’ openness offer surprising comforting thought miriam going try prepare death concludes maybe help take matter hand hastings miriam hook celebrant kate kate run coffin club monthly meetup people seeking emotional practical support thing death related including building decorating coffin within minute miriam slotting flat pack coffin together painting unique design lid getting grip death help miriam realise end day ’ scary feared people confronting terror dying requires extreme measure san francisco miriam accompanies carolyn doctor following sudden death partner last six month carolyn undergone controversial treatment using psychedelic drug help overcome fear dying dr phil wolfson pioneer hallucinogenic psychotherapy treating end life anxiety horse tranquiliser recreational party drug ketamine illegal unless administered doctor dr phil belief whilst influence drug carolyn ’ mind transported anxiety reduced seen carolyn ’ fear diffused miriam start wonder ketamine might way focus le ego instead trust everything fine dy body soul melding back cosmos preparing death also mean accept none u know come people end life plan involve building coffin choosing sandwich filling want choose go amsterdam miriam meet dr death aka maverick doctor philip nitschke run controversial right die movement exit international campaign rational people 50 right end life peacefully time choosing although assisted suicide legal netherlands requires convincing doctor necessity laboratory dr nitschke demo latest invention miriam prototype suicide pod called sarco witnessing sarcophagusstyle tank fill deadly nitrogen miriam hears plan roll invention willing member general public within next two year hope machine perfect peaceful way people take control death although intellectual supporter idea assisted suicide miriam worry dr nitschke ’ vision might cheapening life make death easy going along one workshop talk attending people painful terminal illness others want choice opt antilife tell antilife price people ’ thinking end life tyreese telford 18yearold rapper bowel liver cancer determinedly thinking ending life even preparing death choosing fight miriam recites heartfelt rap tyreese written illness despite optimism worry death maybe big even control aspiring footballer became ill tyreese take miriam watch local game realises tyreese ’ positivity allows cling hope;18

But one young resident is questioning her future.;"In one picturesque village in Sussex, life is very different. There’s no crime, debt or homelessness, everyone has a job but no-one earns a wage, and none of the children watch television, use social media, play video games or have a mobile phone.
 
With unique access to this historically private community, this film enters the remarkable village of Darvell, where for almost 50 years an extraordinary radical Christian community, the Bruderhof, has lived outside mainstream society. The film holds a mirror up to modern Britain, with its consumerist concerns, high crime and deprivation rates, and looks at this community's simple way of life, while also exploring the personal costs and sacrifices required to live there.
 
Hannah, Bernard and Hardy are part of the 300-strong village of brothers and sisters living as disciples of Jesus. Bernard, his wife Rachel and their three children live a ‘back to basics’ lifestyle in a shared house with several other families, including Bernard’s parents. Most of their meals are taken with the other residents in a large communal dining room where they eat, sing and worship together.

Outgoing and inquisitive, Hannah is questioning this way of life. At 18, she wants to experience life outside the community she was born into before making a lifelong commitment. The film follows her extraordinary journey as she leaves her family and the familiarity of this closeted community behind, and makes her way to the big city – London. But whilst Hannah experiences the independence of her first paid job, she also begins to question both the Bruderhof way of life and her experiences in mainstream society.

As a teenager, Hardy became acutely aware of the sacrifices members of the Bruderhof have to make. Together with his five siblings, he
rebelled against the ideals of the community, and with their blessing, his family left the Bruderhof and began a new life outside. Hardy has since returned to the community, accepting that a life there is one of sacrifice – not only surrendering all possessions and money, but something greater: giving up personal ambition and the freedom to make his own decisions. Whilst Hardy and Bernard are happy to make this commitment for a greater cause, will the fresh opportunities that Hannah is discovering in the city tempt her away?

Following an anaphylactic reaction at the age of three, William cannot eat certain foods, including nuts, sesame seeds and flax seeds. As a result, the family are brand-loyal to particular products that they know William can safely eat, and they are understandably scared to try new ingredients and foods.

To understand the true cost of the epidemic, Miriam meets Angela, 41. Two years ago, Angela’s leg was amputated. Her weight meant she needed a knee operation, which led to a sepsis infection. Stuck at home, relying on carers to wash, dress and feed her, Angela’s weight upended her life. 

It is not just the current generation that need to heed the warning – with statistics predicting the next generation will be the most obese ever, Miriam learns of the latest government initiative. Across the country, primary school children are being weighed and measured, with the obese invited to attend a 12-week course to improve diet and encourage exercise.

Miriam sits in with Emma, from the Live Lighter weight management team in Sheffield. Emma has the unenviable task of cold-calling parents to suggest their child attends the programme. It is no easy task but at least it is addressing the issue, and Miriam wishes it had been available when she was younger. Keen to know what life is like for a child who is overweight today, Miriam meets up with ten-year-old Claudia. Claudia tells Miriam she ‘knows what it’s like to be judged’. Her accounts of her weight struggles and secret eating have a familiar ring as Miriam realises she has met her mini me. Claudia’s parents worry about name-calling and feel responsible but, as Miriam tells them, the blame game is an easy one.

When Miriam was a kid, before Deliveroo and the advent of the all-you-can-eat buffet, she felt people didn’t worry so much about what they looked like – now so many seem to struggle with weight and body image. To discover why, Miriam enters an extreme world of weight loss, meeting people who have taken controversial steps to cut their weight and their bodies to a more desirable size. Jess was 23 stone – but after NHS weight loss surgery to cut her stomach in half and dramatically reduce the amount she can eat, her weight is plummeting, and she is closer to her Beyoncé-shaped dream body. In Chester, Dr Kerrigan, a leading weight-loss surgeon, explains to Miriam that with the NHS spending a million pounds an hour treating diabetes, this surgery not only helps people lose weight but could save the health service millions in the long run. Jess eats miniscule amounts of food and is on course to lose around a stone a month until she plateaus around ten stone. It is hard for Miriam to process – something clearly needs to be done and surgery may be a short cut to being healthier but is it a short cut to being happier? Miriam can’t help but wonder what psychological effect such an extreme change in eating has.

Jess’s friend Sammy had bariatric surgery two years ago. She has lost over half her body weight but it has left her with excess skin, which she is saving up to have removed. Despite dropping from 16 to eight stone, Sammy tells Miriam she has developed body dysmorphia, meaning she sometimes fails to see herself as slim. As Miriam watches Sammy pick at tiny amounts of the topping on her pizza, most of which she can’t eat or she will be sick, Miriam ponders if striving for a slimmer body should be at any cost.

Bariatric surgery doesn’t appeal to Miriam, who wonders if there is another way. She heads to meet people who have achieved sculpted bodies without surgery, through a regimen of strict diet and exercise. Aeronn has lost four stone in just 25 weeks and is now so happy with his body he feels ready to be judged. He invites Miriam to the Welsh Natural Body Building championships in Newport, where he is competing. Miriam wonders if body perfection is the dream, will everyone she meets be blissfully happy? She soon gets her answer. Bart is only 16 but despite having an impressive physique, he wants bigger arms and more muscle and tells Miriam he does bodybuilding to make him feel better about himself.

Miriam starts to wonder if our search for body perfection is just swapping one obsession for another in search of an unobtainable dream. Back home, she re-evaluates her own life. She is overweight, sure, but she is loved by her partner, had doting parents and has good friends, so, despite being 'fat at 78', maybe she has done ok on the important stuff.

But as animals get older, they come to rely on their keepers more. Thorn is having problems with his hooves, which have become overgrown. For the vet to get close enough to treat Thorn's hooves, the keepers need to train Thorn to lift his foot on command. Can the keepers train this giant giraffe without getting in the way of a potentially killer kick?

Elsewhere in the park, another team of vets are preparing to perform a procedure on a pair of male reindeer. They need to have their antlers removed before the new growth starts, and it’s a physically demanding job. Reindeer antlers are incredibly tough and need to be sawn off by hand while the animal is sedated.

Dominic Chinea takes on a repair of huge significance to the residents of the village of Norton in Northamptonshire: a faded and misshapen wooden memorial board recording the names of all the men of the village who served in the First World War. Sadly, the names have eroded over time, and many are no longer legible. With the centenary of the 1918 armistice looming, the villagers would dearly love to see the names of the fallen restored so that they can be honoured for years to come. Dom is apprehensive about taking on such an important and time-sensitive repair, but relishes the opportunity to get out his gold leaf kit and bring the faded names back to life.

Maxine Frodsham arrives at the workshop with a dearly loved teddy bear for the attention of toy restoration duo Amanda and Julie. The bear belonged to Maxine’s stepfather Ian, for whom he was a constant companion right from the day he was born over 60 years ago. Sadly, Ian passed away recently, and Maxine and the rest of his family are desperate to see his much-loved plaything restored as a fitting tribute to Ian’s memory.

And ‘Pinball Geoff’ Harvey works his magic on an iconic German-built one-armed bandit that owner Freyja Burrell has treasured ever since she was given it by her father, aged just 4. Known as Beromats, these machines were highly popular in the 1960s, and this particular example held Freyja enthralled throughout her childhood.

Multiple teams must decide whether a man's damaged arm can be saved.;"The major trauma team in Addenbrooke's are up against the clock to treat some of the country's most critically injured patients. Chef Adrian is rushed to hospital in the early hours of the morning after crashing his motorbike at high speed, trapping his arm between the crash barrier and impaling his abdomen with a piece of metal. Having lost a third of his circulating blood, Adrian is in a critical condition when he arrives in the trauma department’s resus bay with potential internal haemorrhaging along with the threat of losing a limb.

Led by Dr Mariam Imam, a specialist major trauma team rapidly assembles to assess the external damage before Adrian is sent to CT to see if the metal has pierced any vital organs. The scan very quickly rules this out, so all attention turns to his arm and hand, which are so badly mangled that his hand is potentially beyond repair. Emergency surgeons assess the arm and rush Adrian to theatre so that consultant plastic and hand surgeon Alex Reid can explore the extent of the damage. After determining that there is decent blood supply to the hand, Adrian’s limb is stabilised until he can undergo further surgery.

Forty-eight hours later, Adrian is brought back to theatre with consultant plastic and hand surgeon Ian Grant. He and his surgical colleagues must decide whether they can save Adrian's hand.

Back in the emergency department, the major trauma team prepare for the arrival of another injured patient, a 25-year-old man transferred to Addenbrooke's from hospital in Colchester. Cawley has been assaulted and after hitting his head on the pavement has a life-threatening bleed on the brain. Having been assessed at Colchester, Cawley was put in an induced coma to control the build-up of pressure within his brain and then transferred to Addenbrooke's, which has the trauma specialists he needs for treatment.

At Addenbrooke's, the on-call neurosurgical team, with consultant Angelos Kolias and senior registrar Harry Bulstrode, are on standby to perform an emergency craniotomy to remove the build-up of blood within Cawley’s brain.

Back down in resus, the red phone alerts the team of another incoming patient who has been involved in a head-on car accident. Thirty nine-year-old Sarah has been significantly injured in a high-impact collision which has left her with a broken leg and fractured c-spine. If Sarah doesn’t receive emergency care, the spine fracture could become dislodged and sever the spinal cord, leaving her paralysed from the neck down.  

With an injury threatening the spinal cord, Dr Sarah Hazelman and a team of trauma doctors immediately arrange for a CT scan to assess the severity of the fracture. After seeing that the fracture is stable, priorities rapidly switch when the scan picks up that a shard of bone from her broken leg is pressing on an artery, which could lead to severe complications and the loss of Sarah's foot if the blood flow is not quickly restored.  

On-call trauma and orthopaedic surgeon Hassan Fawi has to act rapidly to reset Sarah's leg and restore the flow of blood. Only then can the attention return to the fractured neck, which needs to be kept stable.  

Two days after the accident, consultant orthopaedic spinal surgeon Doug Hay has to carefully rebuild the broken vertebrae in Sarah's neck using a small piece of bone from her hip along with a titanium plate to secure the join. Without the operation, Sarah could become paralysed, but there is also a risk of causing permanent damage to the spinal cord during the operation itself.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains upsetting scenes.;2021;59;lifestyle, signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0b1qvq5.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0b1qvq5.jpg;major trauma team addenbrookes clock treat country critically injured patient chef adrian rushed hospital early hour morning crashing motorbike high speed trapping arm crash barrier impaling abdomen piece metal lost third circulating blood adrian critical condition arrives trauma department ’ resus bay potential internal haemorrhaging along threat losing limb led dr mariam imam specialist major trauma team rapidly assembles ass external damage adrian sent ct see metal pierced vital organ scan quickly rule attention turn arm hand badly mangled hand potentially beyond repair emergency surgeon ass arm rush adrian theatre consultant plastic hand surgeon alex reid explore extent damage determining decent blood supply hand adrian ’ limb stabilised undergo surgery fortyeight hour later adrian brought back theatre consultant plastic hand surgeon ian grant surgical colleague must decide whether save adrian hand back emergency department major trauma team prepare arrival another injured patient 25yearold man transferred addenbrookes hospital colchester cawley assaulted hitting head pavement lifethreatening bleed brain assessed colchester cawley put induced coma control buildup pressure within brain transferred addenbrookes trauma specialist need treatment addenbrookes oncall neurosurgical team consultant angelos kolias senior registrar harry bulstrode standby perform emergency craniotomy remove buildup blood within cawley ’ brain back resus red phone alert team another incoming patient involved headon car accident thirty nineyearold sarah significantly injured highimpact collision left broken leg fractured cspine sarah ’ receive emergency care spine fracture could become dislodged sever spinal cord leaving paralysed neck injury threatening spinal cord dr sarah hazelman team trauma doctor immediately arrange ct scan ass severity fracture seeing fracture stable priority rapidly switch scan pick shard bone broken leg pressing artery could lead severe complication loss sarah foot blood flow quickly restored oncall trauma orthopaedic surgeon hassan fawi act rapidly reset sarah leg restore flow blood attention return fractured neck need kept stable two day accident consultant orthopaedic spinal surgeon doug hay carefully rebuild broken vertebra sarah neck using small piece bone hip along titanium plate secure join without operation sarah could become paralysed also risk causing permanent damage spinal cord operation;0

Having long buried his emotions, after 20 years can he come to terms with his grief?;"After ten years in the reality TV spotlight, it might appear that everything in Joey Essex’s life is ‘reem’. But fame and a luxury lifestyle haven’t been able to heal the grief he has kept inside for 20 years. Now, as he turns 30, Joey wants to embark on a deeply personal journey to take stock of his life and, for the sake of his future, finally confront his past.

Every year, 41,00 young people lose a parent in the UK. At the age of just ten, Joey's world was ripped apart when his mum tragically took her own life. Unable to comprehend the loss, Joey has spent the next 20 years of his life burying his grief. He has kept his emotions hidden, rarely spoken about his mother and avoided having pictures of her in his home. But now, as he leaves his twenties behind, he is ready to confront his trauma so he can move forward with his life.

With the help of a clinical psychologist, Dr Stephen Blumenthal, Joey sets out to finally face the impact his beloved mother’s death has had on him. Up until now, he has only really opened up about his childhood with his family, but even his sister Frankie and cousin Chloe recognise that he has never truly processed his feelings or fully faced his bereavement. Opening up to a psychologist and learning to trust Stephen will be a tough first step.

From talking about his emotions to putting more pictures of his mum around his house and finding a way of coping with his anxiety, Joey is determined to face his fears head on. After an unsure start and trust issues threaten to derail the process, he realises that to be able to move on with his life he has to look back at his past.

Emmalina has been hearing a collection of voices since she was a child and has found that by welcoming them in, they can all live relatively peacefully - except when the voice of 'the devil' appears. After traumatic experiences earlier in her life, the voices have become a source of comfort and companionship, but they have also made her more isolated. We follow Emmalina as she strives to become more independent.

Taking a ferry across the Strait of Gibraltar, Simon's first stop is Ceuta, a Spanish exclave surrounded by Morocco. This is one of the few land borders between Africa and the European Union. Simon joins the Spanish border police who check engines and even dashboards for stowaways trying to reach Europe. Migrant and refugees attempting to cross Ceuta's fortress border have quadrupled in the last year. Undaunted by Morocco's failure to issue a filming permit, Simon crosses the border as a tourist, tracking down a group of young migrants hiding out in a forest close to Ceuta. They have travelled thousands of miles, crossing the Sahara to get this far, and now they are just a 20-foot, razor wire fence away from their European dream.

Crossing the Med to Spain, one the busiest shipping lanes in the world, Simon discovers huge numbers of dolphins and even giant whales surviving by dodging the ferries, container ships and oil tankers. Travelling along the arid southern Spanish coast, Simon takes to air to witness the sea of plastic that form over a hundred square miles of greenhouses. It is where much of our supermarket fruit and veg are grown, but as Simon discovers it is a massive industry built on the back of a low paid, migrant workforce. Following in the footsteps of four million Brits who make the journey every year, Simon travels to the Costa Blanca and its most famous resort, Benidorm. Derided by many, Simon is surprised to learn that high-rise Benidorm is now being hailed by experts as a model of sustainable tourism. The Mediterranean region attracts a third of world tourism and visitor numbers are predicted to rise to half a billion a year by the end of the next decade. Simon travels to a western corner of Corsica, a nature reserve that must be one of the most heavily protected bits of sea on earth, and one of the few places where tourists are actively discouraged from visiting. Lying on the beach, hiking in the mountains and watersport activities are all banned. The park's manager shows Simon the results, taking him for a dive in the fishiest place in the Med.

The next day sees Iain stunned and cheered as he unexpectedly catches a glimpse of the sea. From his vantage point, he watches the River Spey snake its way through Morayshire and join the Moray Firth into the North Sea. Buoyed by this, he pushes forward on his adventure towards Fochabers, knowing that the next day he will be following the Spey all the way to the sea. Finally reaching the coast, Iain realises that this is a moment he will never forget as his achievement begins to sink in.

Although this may be a fitting point to end his adventure, Iain pushes on and joins the Moray Coast Trail, heading towards Cullen before eventually making it to Buckie. He enjoys another slight diversion before starting his final day with a ramble along a fairy path, spotting small fairy houses that have been erected on the path up to Craigmin Bridge.

As he returns to Buckie, he is joined by actor and playwright Joanne Gallagher for the last few miles of his journey. The walking on this stretch offers outstanding views of Scotland’s coast, but Iain is keen to push forward to enjoy some time at Bow Fiddle Rock, one of his favourite spots. Soon after, they reach the beach in Cullen, and Iain takes his shoes off to saunter the last few hundred metres of the way through the surf as he reminisces about the last 131 miles and the friends who helped make it so memorable.";Lifestyle;BBC SCOTLAND;False;2022;28;lifestyle;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0bcc3vf.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0bcc3vf.jpg;packing much possibly final third 131mile speyside way walk iain robertson celebrates river ’ whisky tradition fairy walk even one favourite scottish landmark heading ballindalloch iain joined musician paul anderson tease iain promise tune fiddle manages extra mile past aberlour craigellachie bridge paul explains river spey fastest flowing river british isle despite deceptively gentle look head across bouncy bridge past smell whisky mash take decision push craigellachie bridge paul treat iain tune dedicated brig next day see iain stunned cheered unexpectedly catch glimpse sea vantage point watch river spey snake way morayshire join moray firth north sea buoyed push forward adventure towards fochabers knowing next day following spey way sea finally reaching coast iain realises moment never forget achievement begin sink although may fitting point end adventure iain push join moray coast trail heading towards cullen eventually making buckie enjoys another slight diversion starting final day ramble along fairy path spotting small fairy house erected path craigmin bridge return buckie joined actor playwright joanne gallagher last mile journey walking stretch offer outstanding view scotland ’ coast iain keen push forward enjoy time bow fiddle rock one favourite spot soon reach beach cullen iain take shoe saunter last hundred metre way surf reminisces last 131 mile friend helped make memorable;10

In a series of encounters – with politicians and peacemakers, with perpetrators and victims of violence – she asks what religion has done for us, and to us, and assesses the role it could yet play in sustaining peace. 

In the last interview before her death, Pat Hume, widow of the late Nobel Peace Laureate, John, discusses the faith and vision that sustained him.  
Mary finds common ground with her ex-student, the former DUP First Minister, Arlene Foster, whose family, like her own, was forced from their home by paramilitaries, but who sees a positive role for faith in building mutual understanding.  

Alan McBride, whose wife and father-in-law were among 10 people killed in the Shankill fish shop bomb, later agreed to meet Gerry Adams, who had helped carry the coffin of the bomber, Thomas Begley. Alan’s faith has inspired him to a life of cross-community support for victims of trauma. 

Former Sinn Fein President, Gerry Adams, discusses the role played by Clonard priest, Fr Alec Reid in engineering secret talks between himself and John Hume, to create a pathway to peace for the IRA. The Rev Harold Good, who was one of only two people trusted by all sides to verify weapons decommissioning, talks of the need for churches to leave their silos and engage with people with whom they disagree in what he calls the No Man’s Land of a divided society. 

Russell Watton, who was given three life sentences for a Loyalist gun attack on a Catholic bar, is now committed to peaceful, democratic politics as a PUP councillor. He questions the extent to which the Loyalist cause was ever 'For God and Ulster' as the UVF motto declared. Seana Walsh served three sentences for his role in the IRA and was a close friend of the hunger striker, Bobby Sands. But was he a Provo because of his Catholic faith or in spite of it?  

Finally, Mary meets a group of young people, born after the Good Friday Agreement, for whom the old Protestant/Catholic, British/Irish labels are no longer adequate.

He investigates the complex worlds of these three dog breeds, explores why there is a boom in people buying and breeding ‘popular’ dogs, questions whether it is causing an animal welfare crisis and asks what can be done to help alleviate the problems?  
 
Fabian has witnessed the puppy boom first-hand through his work at a small animal's veterinary practice in Birmingham. The huge increase in the numbers of people wanting to buy a puppy has resulted in prices going up, which in turn has led to more people breeding dogs and has boosted the relatively new canine fertility industry, with a proliferation of canine fertility clinics offering artificial insemination services for dogs and new training courses that teach people how to do artificial insemination themselves. 
 
Fabian explores the huge price tags for some puppies and what draws people to these popular breeds, unpacks some of the hereditary health and welfare issues the breeds face, and he hears from the Dogs Trust that many puppies bought online are being illegally imported to the UK, requiring tighter regulations needed to improve the situation. Fabian also meets some prospective owners, introducing them to the RSPCA so they can find out the best practice when it comes to buying a new puppy. He also speaks to the RSPCA about the growing problem of dogs having their ears cropped, which has become popular with bully breeds, and highlights how barbaric and damaging this practice is. 
 
To explore the rise in new breeders, Fabian hears from owners about their experiences of breeding their own dogs and the challenges and costs they have faced. He also meets people who have recently opened their own canine fertility clinics and hears concerns about what is being taught on one training course. He also uncovers evidence of worrying, illegal techniques being taught to amateurs on a canine fertility course. After showing footage to a veterinary expert in dog breeding, Fabian takes his findings to the government's chief veterinary officer, Christine Middlemiss, to discuss what happens next and whether more regulation is needed.

Fabian ends the documentary by revealing how the journey of the young couple wanting to buy a dog has concluded and by offering his insight into what can be done to improve the welfare of the nation’s favourite pet.";Documentary;BBC THREE;Contains upsetting scenes.;2021;58;lifestyle, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09pdhq3.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09pdhq3.jpg;vet fabian river reveals pandemic triggered boom demand puppy particularly three breed bully frenchies dachshund investigates complex world three dog breed explores boom people buying breeding ‘ popular ’ dog question whether causing animal welfare crisis asks done help alleviate problem fabian witnessed puppy boom firsthand work small animal veterinary practice birmingham huge increase number people wanting buy puppy resulted price going turn led people breeding dog boosted relatively new canine fertility industry proliferation canine fertility clinic offering artificial insemination service dog new training course teach people artificial insemination fabian explores huge price tag puppy draw people popular breed unpacks hereditary health welfare issue breed face hears dog trust many puppy bought online illegally imported uk requiring tighter regulation needed improve situation fabian also meet prospective owner introducing rspca find best practice come buying new puppy also speaks rspca growing problem dog ear cropped become popular bully breed highlight barbaric damaging practice explore rise new breeder fabian hears owner experience breeding dog challenge cost faced also meet people recently opened canine fertility clinic hears concern taught one training course also uncovers evidence worrying illegal technique taught amateur canine fertility course showing footage veterinary expert dog breeding fabian take finding government chief veterinary officer christine middlemiss discus happens next whether regulation needed fabian end documentary revealing journey young couple wanting buy dog concluded offering insight done improve welfare nation ’ favourite pet;1

Determined to stay near friends and family, Jody and Lori decided to gamble everything they have on building a new home from scratch. If they get it right, they will have saved in the region of £200k!

Piers is concerned they have started building before the design is finished. He suggests a series of changes that could turn a very generic house into something flooded with natural light, gets the most out of a limited plot and is full of practical storage ideas to suit a young family.

Kieran takes the couple to see a series of homes tailor-made for the people that live in them. Each is packed with ideas they could try, from a lighting design that works for cosy nights and big parties, ingenious ways of using wallpaper to mark out a dining area and how to disguise a kitchen in an open-plan space.

As the build gathers pace, Lori struggles to make colour choices beyond simply greys and whites, but Piers believes colour is exactly the low-cost trick they need. He explains the basics of colour theory, but will they really move from safe whites and greys to bold oranges and blues?

Now on the path to recovery, he wants to understand what caused his addiction. Could it be the way his brain is wired, his environment or both? Paul sets out to meet old teammates, scientists and psychologists to see if he can get close to finding the answer. He starts by meeting former Arsenal teammate Wes Reid. When they received their first pay cheques as Arsenal trainees, Paul and Wes went to the bookies, and Paul lost his entire week’s wages in 15 minutes, kicking off a 35-year struggle with gambling. 

Paul also meets footballers Keith Gillespie, John Hartson and Scott Davies, who between them gambled away £15 million, and he visits the families of three men who took their own lives as a result of gambling addiction. At Imperial College London, he talks to Dr David Erritzoe, a consultant psychiatrist whose team of researchers are mapping the brain, trying to pinpoint the neurobiological basis of gambling addiction so that new treatments can be developed.

Surely things can't have changed too much?;"Mammoth is a comedy show about the life of PE teacher Tony Mammoth. Mammoth is a man literally out of time. In 1979 he was a happy-go-lucky PE teacher, leading a school skiing trip to the French Alps. Life was good. Right up until an avalanche decided to ruin his day by sweeping him away to what was surely his death: a death which would break the hearts of all the kids that he taught, almost all of his colleagues and several mothers, and devastate his best friend and wingman Roger Buck.

Except, of course, Mammoth didn’t die. He was miraculously found and brought back to life 42 years later. A perfectly preserved man in his forties. Just one born 86 years ago. For a time, he was a global phenomenon. The world was his oyster. But Mammoth has never really liked oysters; he's more of a pub lunch and a pint sort of bloke. 

He was given the one thing that everyone at some point wishes they were given - a second chance at life. An opportunity to right wrongs.
But the simple fact is that Mammoth was pretty sure that he absolutely nailed life the first time around, so all he really wanted was his old life back. The same job. The same car. The same friends.

It's a world that Nina, an undiagnosed autistic woman, is about to shake up.;"Nina is autistic, but yet to be diagnosed. She has always felt different – and is often made to feel it by her family. But Nina finds happiness in the world thanks to her love of paleontology, and she spends all the time she can indulging in the exhibitions on dinosaurs and fossils at the local museum. Yet when her bubbly younger sister Evie asks Nina to be her maid of honour, Nina decides to step out of her comfort zone with a challenge: to find herself a date to bring to the wedding. Nina has never been too bothered by dating before, but after her sister’s engagement, she's curious: what's the big fuss all about? If everyone says love is so difficult, why does everyone want it all the time? She’s determined to find out for herself once and for all.

Tackling the terrors of dating apps, and armed with make-up tips and unintended pick-up lines from Evie and the internet, Nina pursues a date with nerdy but endearing Lee. After a bumpy start, the pair soon hit it off over a common love of fan fiction, and Nina even agrees to send Lee some of her own work. However, things quickly start to get confusing when Nina finds Lee doesn’t seem quite as interested in chatting after the date ends.

Smarting from unanswered texts and feeling slightly sidelined at Evie’s engagement party, Nina decides to confide in her older brother Bo for advice. However, the recently dumped Bo quickly makes his feelings known that Nina is way out of her depth; the trials and tribulations of dating are not worth her time. Nina is frustrated. When everyone else is lying and playing games, why does it feel like she’s the odd one out in the dating charade?

However, without sustenance, can they handle the hunger long enough to capture their prey?;"Further ludicrous law enforcement from Scotland’s funniest force.

The final episode of the series sees the Scot Squad continue their relentless pursuit of misdemeanour, misdeed and malfeasance, finding themselves falling victim to hunger, alcohol and the irresistible laws of attraction.

When it comes to Mother Nature, Chief Commissioner Cameron Miekelson is a self-proclaimed 'mummy’s boy', and as such, he is acutely aware of climate change. In preparation for the potential change in Scotland’s weather, he has designed some new uniforms to deal with whatever the climate, and the criminals, can throw at his officers. Come hail, rain or shine, nothing will stop the police shutting down shenanigans.

Back together as policing partners, PCs MacIntosh and Mackay are called to an illegal drinking den. However, as they bust the boozy bar, it becomes clear that this speakeasy isn’t quite what it seems. Meanwhile, detectives Squire and McGill are on a lengthy stakeout, poised to pounce on their perpetrator. However, without sustenance, can these professionals handle the hunger long enough to capture their prey?

Elsewhere, love is in the air as remote investigators Annie McInnes and Archie Pepper take a little time out from cracking down on cyber criminals to celebrate Valentine's Day.

Bryn is cooking dinner for over 13 people, and understandably, he is tense. Pam would secretly prefer to spend Christmas in Essex, as she finds Gwen's house a bit lacking. But the deal has always been that they alternate every year, and this time it's the turn of the Wests to host Christmas with everyone under one small roof.

For Gavin and Stacey, parenthood continues to present them with several challenges, their 'baby' now being ten. Smithy, too, continues to commit to his fatherly role, making the journey to Barry at weekends and every second Wednesday to see 12-year-old Neil the Baby. Nessa, on the other hand, adopts her own brand of Nessa-style mothering, whilst Pam, Mick and Gwen have become the epitome of doting grandparents.

Louise is moving in with Joe, Donna has bagged a rich man with no personality and Karen has found herself a chauvinist.;"One-off special comedy based around the tangled love lives of three women. 

Louise is moving in with Joe, the love of her life; Donna has found a rich man with no personality; and Karen has realised that the only thing a woman really wants in life is to make her man happy, so she has found herself a chauvinist.  

So everything's sorted, or at least until things start to go wrong. Louise discovers that in actual fact she sort of hates the love of her life and spends more and more time trying to get away from him.  

Karen is fine until Billy staggers back into her life and tells her that he's dying. She decides that she's going help him do all the things in life that he wished he done. What she didn't realise was that all these things were to be done on drugs and she is soon sucked back into a world of drunken insanity.  

Donna is fine until Karl comes back from Italy. The moment she discovers this she dumps her new rich man, but when she discovers that Karl has returned to marry his Italian girlfriend, she immediately picks the rich man up again and pretends that everything is fine. Donna sees the girlfriend with someone else, but is told that they are having an open relationship. Donna is horrified at what Italy has done to the man she once loved.

Things come to a head when Joe, misreading Louise's reticence as love, invites her into a hot-air balloon and promptly asks her to marry him. She turns him down.

While Isa gets into a fix with some cute little animals, Jack and Victor decide to stop putting things off and go on that adventure they have been planning for years. A new month rolls round and Jack is excited to see what new picture he will reveal on his calendar, but tensions quickly rise as Victor tries to meddle in his fun. Heading to The Clansman for a calming pint, they suggest Boaby uncovers November on his calendar, while Tam reveals he is far too stingy to buy one.

This marching of time has put Jack into a contemplative mood. He is thinking about how he and Victor should stop making up a load of excuses and should instead accomplish their long-standing ambition to climb the world famous Munro, Ben Lomond. Victor’s bright idea for avoiding disappointment every year is to admit defeat, but Jack is having none of it - they are pioneers and they are going for it! With their new resolve, Jack and Victor invite Tam, Winston and Boaby to join the expedition, which quickly sees them scrabbling around for reasons why they can’t possibly go. Turns out, none of them can come up with anything decent so they find themselves agreeing. It is probably for the best anyway.

Over at Navid’s shop, rather than running a mile from charity workers, Isa runs towards them. She is a sucker for a cute little animal story but when Navid finds her acting strangely in the shop, she is forced to admit to him that she has a problem. As Navid conducts an intervention to help Isa onto a better path, the boys head off for Ben Lomond in a bid to conquer that mountain.

In Mission Control, Robert receives a final update from Astronomer Edward, who uploads a picture of Neptune for Stargazers everywhere to look at. Just as Robert is about to enjoy a tasty cake, another message comes into Mission Control. This time it's from Chris, Maggie and the Stargazers, they’ve made it to Neptune! 

Maggie then reveals that when Voyager made it to Neptune, it discovered that there were extreme winds on the planet. The Stargazers feel the power of the wind for themselves when they travel in boats across the lake. More Stargazers then send an update back to Mission Control to inform Robert that both Voyager 1 and 2 are still out there exploring space. They also reveal that the spacecrafts carry a golden record, which has messages, music and pictures from planet Earth. This gives Robert an idea and he surprises Chris and Maggie with messages from Stargazers everywhere about their favourite things on planet Earth. 

Maggie has one final solar system surprise of her own however, and she shows Chris a picture Voyager took on the edge of the solar system. In the picture, planet Earth is a tiny blue dot.

The Twirlywoos find out balancing is harder than it looks when they copy a gymnast.;"Stop-motion preschool programme about the adventures of four inquisitive Twirlywoos. The Twirlywoos are at a gym hall where they watch a gymnast practising a routine on a balance beam. When the gymnast leaves, Toodloo is eager to try it out and leaps up on the beam, performing a gymnastic routine. Chickedy and Chick also try to balance on the beam - they run along it really fast, holding hands to steady themselves. Next it's Great Big Hoo, who finds it difficult and wobbles around, nearly falling off a few times. The others are at the end of the beam encouraging Great Big Hoo along it. Suddenly the gymnast comes back and so Great Big Hoo makes a run for it, getting all the way to the end of the beam and knocking into the others! They fall into the basin of chalk dust that the gymnasts use to help their grip, and as the hooter sounds, they fly away, creating a big cloud of chalk which surprises the gymnast as she comes back into the room.

Back in the boat, a big wave washes Peekaboo and a collection of pebbles out of the hole in the wall and they are scattered all across the boat floor. The Twirlywoos return, but Peekaboo doesn't have enough time to get back into the hole so hides in amongst the pebbles. When the Twirlywoos drop into the boat they land on the pebbles, where they struggle to keep their balance. Chickedy and Chick jump from pebble to pebble like stepping stones, until they unwittingly land on top of Peekaboo's shell. Peekaboo runs off with Chickedy and Chick balancing on top!

He works there with his boss, Mr Hammond and tech wizard Jen, who monitors all the animals from the Aqua Base.

Jen has been working on a new kelp forest for the Aqua Forest Dome, and Mr Hammond calls to find out if it is safe for him to go diving in there. Jen has been very careful to ensure there aren't any dangerous animals in there to hurt him, but when Mr Hammond asks about spiky urchins, Jen starts to look a little worried. She spots hundreds of urchins on the seabed in the new Aqua Dome – not only are they painful to stand on, but they are eating the all the kelp. It’s a disaster! Looking for inspiration in the wild to see how kelp forests deal with urchins, Andy heads out on an aquatic adventure.

Andy boards his safari-sub, a hi-tech underwater submersible capable of travelling to any location on the planet in the blink of an eye. When Andy arrives to the coast of California, he finds a group of male sea otters wrapping themselves up in the kelp so they don’t drift off. Andy would love to stay and watch, but he is on a mission to find out how to stop the urchins. Quite unexpectedly, he gets picked up by a fish called a garibaldi. Garibaldis are very house proud and will remove anything from their territory that doesn’t belong there, including Andy.

The Garibaldi accidentally drops Andy on an urchin spine and goes about moving the rest of the urchins from the nearby seabed. Just when Andy thinks he has his answer, he notices the sea urchins start returning. Is there something else that keeps the urchin numbers down?

But things are not going to get any easier as they face the final Special Forces veteran - Jason Falla, a former member of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, otherwise known as the SASR.

Starting with some authentic strength and fitness drills, Jason puts them trough Iron Bar PT, an exercise designed to break recruits and test those that have prepared themselves physically for the selection course. Following this, they are put through tactical questioning, an interrogation test that shows which recruit is really switched on mentally.

If they can survive Jason and his exacting standards, then maybe they will get through to the final lone warrior challenge, a tough endurance race involving weighted rucksacks and mental tests.

Gracie opened his outstanding professional MMA career by recording nine consecutive wins over  previously undefeated opponents, including eight by submission. His opponent Storley has lost just once in his 13-fight career, with the only blemish on his record a nail-biting, split decision loss to reigning division champion Yaroslav Amosov. The bout promises to produce fireworks as both fighters aim to strengthen their title credentials in the stacked welterweight division. 

The card’s co-main event sees another huge welterweight clash with former Bellator world champion Andrey Koreshkov opening his 2022 campaign against returning veteran Chance Rencountre. Russian Koreshkov shut down the highly rated Sabah Homasi by unanimous decision to notch his 24th win in his most recent fight at Bellator 264 last August. Meanwhile, Rencountre will be hoping to extend his two-bout win streak when he fights under the Bellator banner for the first time in more than four years. The 35-year-old American boasts an impressive career professional record of 16 wins from his 20 fights. 

Elsewhere on the main card is an all-American bout between 44-fight veteran Georgi Karakhanyan and Adam Piccolotti in the lightweight division. Karakhanyan will be aiming to notch an incredible 32nd victory in a career which has spanned 16 years. His opponent Piccolotti has won 12 of his 16 bouts and will be looking to bounce back from a split-decision loss to Sidney Outlaw in his most recent fight at Bellator 244. 

Rounding out the main card is a heavyweight fight between the undefeated Davion Franklin and Surinames’s Said Sowma. Plenty is on the line as the fighters come into the bout tied at eighth in Bellator’s heavyweight rankings, with the winner set to establish himself as one of the division’s top contenders. Sowma will be hoping to continue his fine form having produced back-to-back knockouts in 2021, against Ronny Markes and most recently Vitaly Minakov at Bellator 269 in Moscow.  

Elsewhere on an evening of high-class MMA action Connecticut’s Brennan Ward will be hoping the home support will aide him on his return to the cage following a five year lay-off when he takes on Brandon Bell. DeAnna Bennett welcomes Justine Kish to the Bellator cage at women’s flyweight and in the light heavyweight division Kevin Haley makes his promotional debut against top prospect Christian Edwards.

In the shadow of the civil rights movement and the Troubles, the club managed to keep playing - until the team bus of Ballymena United was caught up in the violence, taken away and burned. Derry City FC was banned from playing at home and eventually went out of business.

In 1984, the city needed a saviour. Tony O’Doherty was a Northern Ireland international who had played against England at Wembley. He teamed up with another international, Terry Harkin, and two other professionals Eddie Mahon and Eamonn McLaughlin, to become the Gang of Four who challenged the status quo. They made it their goal to get senior football back in their hometown.
 
With repeated rebuffs from the Irish League in Belfast to their requests to gain re-entry, the four lads decided to take their footballing revolution south to the League of Ireland in Dublin. 

This film charts the emotional journey of how in 1985, after 13 years in the wilderness, football returned to the Brandywell. The club would go on to lift both silverware and the spirits of the city, unleashing a carnival of hope, pride and optimism.

Featuring interviews with the Gang of Four, rare archive footage and memories of the faithful supporters, the film portrays an inspirational group of people who made their dreams come true. The rollercoaster took the club and community from the depths of despair to footballing nirvana, landing a historic domestic treble in the League of Ireland.

Thanks to Luciano Pavarotti’s rendition of Nessun Dorma and the superb footballing stages of Rome, Milan, Naples and Turin, it became known as ‘The Beautiful Tournament’.

In four short weeks during the summer of 1990, English football was transformed.

After dark years of hooliganism and tragedy, the game in England was revitalised by the performance of the national team at that summer’s World Cup, and a love affair with football was rekindled.

Gazza’s tears, Gary Lineker’s goals and a gripping penalty shoot out all contributed to a football story which increasingly gripped the nation.

Meanwhile, the Italians had their own rising star in the form of Toto Schillaci, who would go on to win the Golden Boot as tournament top scorer. And Cameroon became world sensations, beating former champions Argentina and taking England all the way in a dramatic quarter-final.

Colin Murray journeys around the UK filling in the gaps on the first time that he was allowed to see the other side of midnight. Along the way he finds answers to questions such as where did Dennis's 'upside-down glasses' actually come from? What really went on behind those dressing room doors? How did you spread the news in a world without mobile phones? And how different would the lives of the two protagonists have been if the result had been reversed that night?

But to the people of these two nations there was a hugely significant political context to these tournaments. Both nations won the World Cup while suffering under repressive military dictatorships. And in both cases these violent military juntas used their successful football teams to help improve their image around the world.

For the first time, Barney tells the incredible story, in his own words, of how he managed to take £2m (inflation-adjusted) off the bookies in one eventful hurdle race in 1975 - without breaking the law. With access to the bookmakers and the jockey, as well as stars of racing such as Frankie Dettori and Ian Balding, this is the definitive story of one of the great characters of the turf.

Barney went on to win many other massive bets, famously raffling his mansion and as recently as 2016 making millions from a carefully planned accumulator bet. But he was just as famous for his charity, spending most of his time in the last decade directing the building of schools and hospitals in Zambia. This is the story of a man who won millions, only to voluntarily give them away.

As his side pose a serious challenge to Man United’s dominance, the league’s most infamous feud is born.;"Having won four out of five titles since the start of the Premier League, Manchester United and Alex Ferguson seem unstoppable. In London, Arsenal have barely had a look-in, but vice chairman David Dein has been busy plotting.

He introduces an unknown bespectacled Frenchman to the waiting press at Highbury and announces that he is Arsenal’s new manager. Arsene Wenger looks more like a history teacher than a football manager, and the players have never heard of him. Yet Wenger is about to have a huge impact, not just on the Premier League but on English football, by introducing modern coaching techniques as well as lifestyle and dietary improvements.

The first thing he does is put a stop to the drinking culture – the players’ ‘Tuesday Club’ is consigned to history. He also brings in exciting foreign players from Europe - Patrick Vieira, Marc Overmars, Nicolas Anelka - to play alongside Arsenal stalwarts like captain Tony Adams. On the pitch, Arsenal are turbo-charged, and it’s not long before Alex Ferguson feels the imminent threat, a new rival intent on destroying the legacy he’s building at Manchester United. It’s clear Ferguson is rattled by the new interloper, and the rivalry and tension between the two men is replicated by the players when the two sides meet. It marks the beginning of a ten-year chapter in the Premier league which would become known as The Feud.

But off the pitch, Manchester United’s supporters have another battle on their hands – this time in the boardroom. Sky’s Rupert Murdoch announces an audacious £623m bid to buy the club, which has been accepted by the shareholders.

Having unexpectedly come fourth in Beijing, to do even better at London meant defeating one of the three ‘untouchable’ sporting superpowers: the USA, China and Russia. The athletes would have to put in the performances of their lives. 
 
To boost our chances, the Sporting Giants programme sought to expand our pool of potential medal winners by turning amateurs into elite competitors. Helen Glover was plucked from teacher training and given a shot at Olympic rowing glory. At the same time, the Mission 2012 tracking system monitored sports’ progress towards inescapable medal targets. With so much money on the line, the scrutiny seemed prudent, but at what cost to the athletes who struggled under the immense pressure? 
 
With the eyes of the world on London, 2012 would be a milestone year for the Paralympics – an opportunity to transform the perception of Paralympians as elite athletes and to demonstrate how far the movement had come since the empty stands at Atlanta 16 years earlier.

The number 10 in rugby is arguably the most important player on the pitch. They are the master tactician and the playmaker, the goal kicker and the person who calls the shots. The number 10 shirt carries responsibility, respect and a sense of prestige and the pressure is intense both on and off the pitch. It’s the Irish fascination with the selection of who should wear the number 10 shirt which has produced great debate across the decades and created some of the most intense rivalries in world sport, such as that between Ollie Campbell and Tony Ward or Ronan O’Gara and David Humphreys. 

As the shirt is passed from one player to another and one generation to the next, we explore some of Ireland’s best ever number 10s, examine why the iconic shirt is so important and reflect on many of the most memorable moments in Irish rugby history.

Amidst the grief, disappointment and old fears, new dreams and hopes are now emerging, but so too are new hatreds.

Clash of Futures explores the dramatic era of the 1920s and 30s following the fates of extraordinary men and women using their own diary entries, letters and memoirs. These are people drawn into the war by their convictions. Their loves and decisions bring the history of Europe, with all its contradictions, to life.

Summer 1918. The First World War has been raging for four years. The fronts have long since become deadlocked; hundreds of thousands have died in the brutal trench warfare. But since the entry of the Americans into the war in 1917, Germany is defeated and the armistice comes into effect. 

11 Samhain, 1918. Tha An Cogadh Mòr seachad mu dheireadh thall. Toiseach linn ùr. Am measg caoidh, briseadh-dùil agus seann eagail, tha bruadair is dòchas a' nochdadh às ùr, ach tha agus fuathan ùra cuideachd.
Tha ""Eadar Na Dhà"" a' toirt sùil air na ficheadan 's na tritheadan, a' leantainn sgeulachdan fir is mnathan sònraichte tro na leabhraichean-latha, litrichean is aithrisean aca fhèin. Tharraing na beachdan aca an fheadhainn seo dhan chogadh agus tha sgeulachd nan co-dhùnaidhean is nan gràdhan aca a' toirt sealladh air eachdraidh thoinnte na h-Eòrpa.
Samhradh 1918. Thathar air a bhith a' sabaid sa Chiad Chogadh Saoghail fad ceithir bliadhna. 'S fhada bho dh'fhàs aghaidhean a' bhlàir glaiste; bhàsaich na ceudan mhìltean sa chogadh trainnse brùideil. Ach bho thàinig na h-Ameireaganaich dhan chogadh ann an 1917, fhuair an Caidreabh làmh an uachdair. Tha Arm-staid a' tòiseachadh air an 11mh dhen t-Samhain.

It is the end of the road for Mickey and the gang, but will they go out in a shower of money or a hail of bullets?;"Mickey has found the gang a high-rolling mark who could earn them their biggest jackpot ever - Bahrain businessman Madani Wasem. Having just inherited over 850 million from his father, Wasem is now on a mission to prove his prowess on the stock markets. However, this mark has a darker side. Wasem's mission is to take control of his father's business, but with the key shareholders siding against him he's taken to using murder and intimidation to make his point. This includes the employment of an enforcer, an unseen murderer brought in to dispose of anyone who gets in Wasem's way. 

As the gang research Wasem's dealings it's clear that he's the kind of mark they usually avoid, but Mickey has his own reasons for taking the risk. As he reveals to Albert, he's tired of grifting, and this time a short rest overseas won't cover it; it seems as if Mickey's ready for retirement. This comes as a blow to the others but the prospect of a 10 million pound jackpot is too good to turn down.

The con is set - Mickey tries to hook Wasem by posing as a well-respected stockbroker who's recently been on a winning streak. Stage two is to snare the mark with the promise of guaranteed profits if he invests big, and Mickey's plan is to pretend that they have hacked into the London Stock Exchange to be able to intercept prices a fraction of a second before the rest of the world sees them. But there are more surprises to come and shocked faces aplenty when Wasem's new broker turns out to be none other than Stacie Monroe.

As long as Norman Scott, his vociferous ex-lover is around, Thorpe's brilliant career is at risk, and eventually Thorpe can see only one way to silence Scott for good.

But Annie proves too hot to handle: before Fred knows what's what, she has seduced him.

Moving into his mother Veronica's home to be with his elder brother Nathan, 23, Ray witnesses an argument which escalates into a violent axe attack perpetrated on his brother by his mum's partner Scott.

Although arrested and tried, Scott is acquitted and soon returns to live in the family home. Family life begins to deteriorate, with Nathan becoming reclusive and neglectful of his health and appearance while Ray increasingly takes on the role of carer - for Nathan, for his mother, and for his siblings, Veronica and Scott’s young children. One night, when the boys hear that Scott has threatened to get the axe again, the brothers carry out an attack on Scott, brutally murdering him.

After the murder, the brothers are arrested and charged with Scott’s murder. Nathan and Ray are separated as they enter the judicial system and meet their respective legal teams. Ray's team, headed up by defence Barrister Kerry Stephens, oversees Ray's placement in a foster home (owing to his age and status as a 'looked after child') to await the trail where he will be tried in an adult court alongside his brother.

Kerry and her team prepare Ray’s defence - they will argue that Ray lost control on the night of the attack and should be convicted of manslaughter rather than murder.

She delves into the questions of what, why and how art gets forbidden, who gets to decide and how that has changed over time.

In the first programme, Mary explores some of the challenging ways that artists have shown the human body. She begins with the Romans, heading to the British Museum to discuss a statue of the god Pan having sex with a she-goat, and from there moves through art from the Renaissance to the present day that portrays sex, death, violence and beyond.

Mary meets renowned portraitist Daphne Todd as well as contemporary artists Tracey Emin and Martin Creed to discuss works they’ve produced which feature usually private bodily acts or experiences that, for some, have seemed to go too far.

As the Crown’s case closes, Edward Cairney takes the stand to give evidence and claims that he's incapable of harming a lady.

Michael learns it was a strategic city, situated where the Lowlands meet the Highlands at the lowest bridging point of the River Forth. At a towering monument overlooking the river, Michael hears how, in 1297, William Wallace inflicted a shocking defeat on the English army at Stirling Bridge, and he learns of Edward I’s brutal revenge in 1305. Michael is struck by the emotional power these events retain seven centuries later.

Travelling across country to the River Tay, Michael discovers the fair city of Perth, the historic crowning place of the kings of Scotland. At Scone Palace, now the seat of the Earls of Mansfield, Michael meets William Murray, Viscount Stormont, who is the eldest son of the current Earl, to learn about the Stone of Scone, its seizure and return – ultimately – by the English.

As evening draws in, Michael heads for the banks of the Tay for a magical sunset canoe trip to spot beavers, who are now thriving here once again.

Average property prices are around twice as much as in London’s most exclusive district, Mayfair. One of the main reasons for this is that to qualify for official residency in Monaco (and the financial benefits this brings), you have to own or lease a residence, so demand outstrips supply.
 
The episode takes a tour of an extraordinary new home – Villa Troglodyte, which has come onto the market. Built as if carved out of the rock, the price is only £23 million because it doesn’t have a sea view. 
 
The pressure to build more houses in a small country that is so short on space has left Prince Albert with a challenge. He attends meetings about a huge, new, two-billion-euro land extension project he has initiated. Extending into the sea is a complex operation but once complete, the largest villas there are estimated to sell for around 100 million euros.

In contrast, David Alexanders shows his tiny studio with a total area of 24 square metres. He can only just stand up in it, but it affords him the coveted Monegasque address.
 
With property prices out of their reach in Monaco, Brazilian brothers George and Alexis, dancers with the Ballets de Monte Carlo, travel across the border from France to perform and meet their patron, Princess Caroline.

Downfall;Splits in Mrs Thatcher's cabinet and public anger lead to her eventual downfall.;Mrs Thatcher’s leadership style and judgement on Europe and the poll tax create splits in her cabinet and public anger, leading to the challenge that ends in her dramatic downfall.;"In episode five of the series covers the period after the 1987 election when Mrs Thatcher secured a third term as prime minister. 

She sets out to play a full part in international affairs, partnering with American Presidents Reagan and Bush to engage with the Soviet Union and play a pivotal role in the journey to the end of the Cold War.
 
Her international prominence augments her dominant role in British politics where her long period in office of nearly a decade is unprecedented in the 20th century. Within Downing Street, she has a loyal coterie of advisors who project her influence and protect her position but some feel she has become over dependent on loyalists and detached from opinion with the country and the party.

She continues to push hard for the introduction of a radical reform of local government finance, the community charge. The policy is known as the poll tax and is widely disliked. Despite warnings that the tax will negatively affect her constituency in the country, Mrs Thatcher refuses to compromise. Protests against the tax explode in violence in central London but more damagingly, there is widespread disenchantment in Tory strongholds across the country. 

Fractures emerge with senior cabinet colleagues over European policy that will jeopardise her authority. Her preference for the counsel of a part time advisor over the views of her chancellor on how to position sterling against other European currencies leads to Nigel Lawson's resignation. 

Her prototypical scepticism about Brussels' ambitions for the EU lead to a growing tension with long-term ally Geoffrey Howe. A bravado performance in the House of Commons where she denounces the EU tips Howe into resignation. 

Howe’s departure provokes a leadership challenge from Michael Heseltine who had left the cabinet some years before in protest at Mrs Thatcher's leadership style. Mrs Thatcher is plunged into a leadership contest. In contrast to the contest that propelled her to the party leadership in the 70s, her campaign is poorly organised and she has been weakened by the resignation of senior colleagues and the reverberations of the poll tax.

To her shock she does not defeat Mr Heseltine in the first ballot and is forced into a second ballot. Over a dramatic few days, she consults senior colleagues about whether she can depend on their support in a second ballot. Cabinet members tell her they believe she could lose and that she has lost control of the political momentum. Faced with this, she decides to resign. 

In a highly-dramatic cabinet meeting, she offers a tearful resignation and prepares to leave Downing Street. In the country, emotions run high as supporters lament and opponents celebrate her departure.

It’s currently a dilapidated outside space, mostly enveloped by shade. The only place that does get the sun is where she keeps the bins. Steph’s dream is to have a garden that offers her calm spaces to practise her yoga, but also one that gives her enough space to have a party. She’s chosen her lifelong friend Nicola to support her, but will it be possible to create a garden that can help kickstart the next chapter of her life? 

Stepping up to help are award-winning garden designers Manoj Malde and Pip Probert. Manoj is inspired to bring vibrancy and colour to the space and packs it with different garden rooms, whilst Pip is keen to transform it into a contemporary coastal paradise.

Using virtual reality, both designers pitch their radically different approaches. Manoj tackles the lack of purpose in the space, while Pip chases the sunshine to create light-filled zones to enjoy around the clock.

Frank and Georgia fine-tune a new goat milk ice cream.;"It’s the height of summer - time to prepare for the colder months. This year, coronavirus means farmers are looking much further ahead, finding ways to survive in changing times.

In the Lake District, Matt and Dani Blair are almost a year into their new venture. Matt is preparing for winter, bringing in the hay while the sun shines. But his vintage, temperamental bailer keeps breaking down, and rain is on the way. Later, Matt embarks on a new plan for the farm, and together with Dani, their son James and right-hand man Murray, they consider how the new farm is fairing a year after the big move.

In Northumberland, Emma and Ewan have some big news. After five years working alongside Emma part time, Ewan has decided to leave the fire service and become a full-time farmer. But, their small 100 acre farm can’t sustain them both, so they begin their search for a new, bigger farm.   When the ideal opportunity presents itself on the Isle of Bute, Emma and Ewan decide to go for it and make an offer. If successful, their lives could be about to change.

Joyce Campbell is used to working her 6,000 acre hill farm on the northernmost part of the Scottish mainland alone. Because of coronavirus, twins Frances and Mure have been home from university for the last five months and are helping out on the farm full time. Working together, they move her herd of Saler cross cows two miles along the North Coast 500. Later on, Joyce reveals a very special lockdown purchase.

Father and daughter team Frank and Georgia Hunter are continually finding ways to adapt and survive on their 600 acre mixed livestock farm.  All farmers' markets are cancelled, so Frank instead sets up shop at the end of the lane and encourages people to buy their dairy and meat produce directly. Their decision to diversify into goat farming five years ago is really paying off, and they’ve got another cool idea up their sleeve: goats' milk ice cream.";Documentary;BBC TWO;False;2021;59;signed;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0b0m928.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0b0m928.jpg;’ height summer time prepare colder month year coronavirus mean farmer looking much ahead finding way survive changing time lake district matt dani blair almost year new venture matt preparing winter bringing hay sun shine vintage temperamental bailer keep breaking rain way later matt embarks new plan farm together dani son james righthand man murray consider new farm fairing year big move northumberland emma ewan big news five year working alongside emma part time ewan decided leave fire service become fulltime farmer small 100 acre farm ’ sustain begin search new bigger farm ideal opportunity present isle bute emma ewan decide go make offer successful life could change joyce campbell used working 6000 acre hill farm northernmost part scottish mainland alone coronavirus twin france mure home university last five month helping farm full time working together move herd saler cross cow two mile along north coast 500 later joyce reveals special lockdown purchase father daughter team frank georgia hunter continually finding way adapt survive 600 acre mixed livestock farm farmer market cancelled frank instead set shop end lane encourages people buy dairy meat produce directly decision diversify goat farming five year ago really paying ’ got another cool idea sleeve goat milk ice cream;8

She starts just a stone’s throw from downtown Los Angeles, in a Latino neighbourhood, home to an authentic Central American night market. Here she find the country’s newest arrivals, on the first step of their American dream, cooking up a taste of home: delicious Guatemalan stuffed chilies and, from El Salvador, thick corn tortillas with spicy salsa. 

In LA’s trendy arts district, Nadiya meets Wes Avila, whose gourmet tacos are redefining modern Californian cuisine. She meets Wes’s father, who emigrated to the USA in the 1970s, causing Nadiya to reflect on her own father’s immigration experience.

Nadiya discovers an extravagant way that Latinos are holding on to their heritage. The quinceanera is a lavish 15th birthday party that celebrates a girl's coming of age. At the centre is an elaborate cake and a fairy tale dress. Nadiya is invited to spend a day with a family as they celebrate a full day of cultural festivities. She discovers that, this being America, everything is supersized, with a price tag of $25,000 to mark the occasion.

Over the last three years, hate crimes in the USA have reached an all-time high. Nadiya visits an event at a mosque where halal tacos are being used to bring Latinos and Muslims together and create a greater political voice to tackle racism.

Leaving LA, Nadiya enters a land that looks like the Wild West. Out here, she discovers there is an all-female Mexican rodeo team, who compete alongside the men, carrying out daredevil manoeuvers in a dangerous equestrian ballet that requires skill and bravery. She learns how these modern American Mexican women seamlessly combine their two lives and reflects on her own experience of growing up in two different cultural worlds.

In San Francisco, Nadiya visits the last remaining handmade fortune cookie factory in Chinatown, where she is taught how to mould and fold like the resident expert, the grandma of this family business.

She also visits a charity called La Cocina, which is helping women who are new arrivals in America launch and run their own food businesses.

Following a huge scandal, Rupert cuts a lonely figure. His political allies have deserted him, his reputation is in tatters, his beloved mother passes away, and to add insult to injury, revelations come to light about his wife’s infatuation with one of his friends, ex-prime minister Tony Blair, contributing to the break-up of his second marriage.
 
But Murdoch is tough - he feeds on conflict and revels in playing the underdog, a role he has cast himself in throughout his career. This film examines the source of his drive, determination and grit and the important influence of his father.
 
When two political hopefuls approach Rupert for help, he senses opportunity, and Murdoch’s star begins to rise again. Murdoch’s involvement in the US elections and the Brexit vote sees political relevance return. Murdoch marries his third wife, Jerry Hall, putting himself firmly back at the centre of the power elite, and his amazing comeback nears completion.

She starts this journey at that most spectacular of Roman monuments, Hadrian’s Wall. Alice is on site to witness a new dig at the famous Birdoswald Fort, once home to around 800 Roman infantrymen. She joins a team from Newcastle University as they uncover a completely new building, alluded to in the 1930s but never fully excavated until now.

Next, we travel further north to learn more about the so-called barbarians that the Romans were so worried about. The dig is on the shores of the Moray Firth, where archaeologists are uncovering a fort which once belonged to the Picts. A wealth of new evidence suggests that far from being barbaric savages, they were a sophisticated people who were perhaps far more educated than anyone has given them credit for.

Alice also visits the town of Rochdale in Lancashire, just ten miles outside Manchester, where a huge community dig is altering our understanding of the Industrial Revolution. Alice meets local families who are digging beneath the spectacular Gothic town hall to uncover the remains of terraces and tenement blocks that housed the working men and women of Rochdale, shedding new light on the way industrialisation changed our towns and cities.

In Northern Ireland, another community dig highlights a particularly dark period of recent history, the Great Famine of the mid-19th century. For the first time in Northern Ireland, a team are excavating one of the island of Ireland’s many famine roads. These were roads built by the starving population. Often going nowhere, they were part of a misguided attempt by the British government to boost Irish infrastructure and support the hungry by forcing them to build roads in exchange for money to buy food. Historian Onyeka Nubia travels to London to search for evidence that might explain the British government’s reasoning for what turned out to be a futile relief effort.

Back in Scotland, a new tramline being built from Edinburgh to Leith gives archaeologists the opportunity to study and preserve hundreds of skeletons unearthed at a graveyard dating back to 1300. This dig throws new light on the residents of Leith as they lived through 500 years of Scotland’s history. In the Digging for Britain tent, archaeologist John Lawson brings in one skeleton with a unique set of injuries, and an incredible facial reconstruction brings her vividly to life.

It’s an exciting milestone for them both, but for some disabled young adults like Harvey it also brings a daunting uncertainty as the people and places that have cared for him as a child are about to change. Now Harvey and Katie must navigate this transition together, and Katie has some tough decisions to make on Harvey's behalf - such as where he will live and what his future will look like - and in doing so she must also learn to let go.    
    
Harvey was born with septic optic dysplasia, a rare disorder that affects brain function, hormones and vision, and affects one in 10,000 births. He has a long list of medical and behavioural conditions, and his future is unpredictable. As he moves into adulthood, it marks a transition into unchartered territory as there are no other adults known to have Harvey’s combination of conditions.    

As Harvey and Katie explore the options of further education colleges and meet other families with disabled young adults, he reconnects with an old friend whose been through his transition year and is now flourishing in college, and whose mum gives Katie some sound advice. 

Katie is forced to face what could be at stake if she makes the wrong decision, meeting Isabelle, whose autistic son Matthew was sectioned at 15 years old. Katie discovers that there are over 2,000 people with autism or learning disabilities currently kept against their will in assessment and treatment units.

He digs deep into Joe's background, meets Carole Baskin and asks what made the Tiger King.;"This 90-minute special sees Louis Theroux travel to America to investigate the story of a man who has become one of the most controversial and captivating icons of recent times: the gun-toting, self-described 'gay hillbilly' and 'Tiger King' Joe Exotic.

A decade on from when he first met Joe for the documentary America’s Most Dangerous Pets, Louis returns to Oklahoma, responding to a direct call from Joe to tell the ‘real story’ and to explore the saga of an animal hoarder turned convicted felon. Joe now resides in a federal prison, having been found guilty of a murder-for-hire plot and multiple animal cruelty charges. But rather than living as a pariah, Joe is now a media phenomenon, the object of international obsession for pundits, celebrities and viewers, with a well-funded campaign team attempting to win him a presidential pardon. 
 
Looking back at his original documentary, Louis reflects on hours of unseen footage and sets out to understand who the real Joe Exotic is and how he used his considerable charm and wiles to assemble a vast menagerie of animals and humans, all roped into a grand project of vanity and deception. Meeting old friends and family members of Joe’s, Louis picks apart the true crime story of how Joe came to be convicted. He also tells the story of Joe’s captivating charisma and the way in which it became a key ingredient in a viral television sensation, with life-changing consequences for all those involved - most of all Carole Baskin, originally the object of Joe’s vitriol, who found herself the target of his murder-for-hire plot and a mass trolling campaign.
 
He digs deep into Joe’s family, unearthing the origin story of Joe’s pathology and laying bare an only-in-America saga that is part crime story, part media spectacle, part animal rights campaign but ultimately a 21st-century fable of a cowboy-cum-cult leader whose very fragility became a source of power - a power which, in some respects, persists to this day.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains very strong language and upsetting scenes.;2021;89;signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09d6whr.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09d6whr.jpg;90minute special see louis theroux travel america investigate story man become one controversial captivating icon recent time guntoting selfdescribed gay hillbilly tiger king joe exotic decade first met joe documentary america ’ dangerous pet louis return oklahoma responding direct call joe tell ‘ real story ’ explore saga animal hoarder turned convicted felon joe resides federal prison found guilty murderforhire plot multiple animal cruelty charge rather living pariah joe medium phenomenon object international obsession pundit celebrity viewer wellfunded campaign team attempting win presidential pardon looking back original documentary louis reflects hour unseen footage set understand real joe exotic used considerable charm wile assemble vast menagerie animal human roped grand project vanity deception meeting old friend family member joe ’ louis pick apart true crime story joe came convicted also tell story joe ’ captivating charisma way became key ingredient viral television sensation lifechanging consequence involved carole baskin originally object joe ’ vitriol found target murderforhire plot mass trolling campaign dig deep joe ’ family unearthing origin story joe ’ pathology laying bare onlyinamerica saga part crime story part medium spectacle part animal right campaign ultimately 21stcentury fable cowboycumcult leader whose fragility became source power power respect persists day;1

David Olusoga exposes the secret files behind the Windrush scandal.;"David Olusoga opens secret government files to show how the Windrush scandal and the ‘hostile environment’ for black British immigrants has been 70 years in the making. 

The film features Sarah O’Connor, Anthony Bryan and Judy Griffith. Settled here legally since childhood, they were re-classified as illegal immigrants by new ‘hostile environment’ regulations. Unable to show proof of their nationality status, they lost jobs, savings and their health, facing deportation back to countries they could barely remember. 

David reveals how today’s scandal is rooted in the secrets of the past. The first Windrush generation were Commonwealth citizens - many of them ex-servicemen - coming to rebuild war-torn Britain. Yet even before arriving, they were viewed by the government with hostility. Civil servants and MPs warned of dire consequences if what they called a ‘coloured element’ was introduced into the UK. PM Clement Attlee even suggested diverting the Windrush passengers to east Africa - to pick peanuts.
 
The same government was actively recruiting tens of thousands of white volunteer workers from Europe - some of them former members of Waffen-SS regiments which stood accused of war crimes on the Eastern Front - for ‘permanent settlement here with a view to their inter-marrying and complete absorption into our own working population’. The files expose how successive British governments spent the next decade trying to devise a way to prevent further Caribbean arrivals without appearing to discriminate against them. PM Winston Churchill, dissatisfied with ministers’ response to what he saw as a serious problem, kept the issue on the cabinet agenda and a special Working Party was set up to gather information to make the political case for immigration controls. Two weeks after the Queen’s coronation as head of the UK and Commonwealth, a secret race survey was undertaken and completed, looking for proof that Commonwealth immigrants were a burden on the welfare state. Chief constables in major cities were asked if ‘the coloured community as a whole, or particular sections of it, are generally idle or poor workmen’, and if they were ‘addicted to drug-trafficking or other types of crime’. The Working Party found no evidence for the view that the ‘coloured community’ was less law-abiding or hard working than other Brits. 
 
When Harold Macmillan’s government introduced the 1962 Immigration Act, its control mechanism was the employment prospects of would-be immigrants. The files show how home secretary ‘Rab’ Butler, described the ‘great merit’ of the scheme was that it ‘can be presented as making no distinction on grounds of race or colour’, but would, in practice, ‘operate on coloured people almost exclusively’. By that time, Caribbean immigration had shrunk to a fraction of earlier levels. But, fearing further restrictions, the Windrush generation now arranged for their children to come. The ‘children of the Windrush' had full legal rights to join their parents in the UK, and many arrived with little paperwork or official record keeping. 
 
Successive governments passed new immigration and nationality legislation, often in response to perceived ‘problems’ or ‘crises’. Harold Wilson rushed through the 1968 Immigration Act, in just three days to stop arrivals of thousands of passport-holding British-Indians living in Kenya, whose businesses and livelihoods were threatened by its government. Edward Heath’s 1971 Act tried to restrict the legal definition of ‘Britishness’. It also placed the burden of proof on the claimant should their Britishness be challenged - a fateful clause for the ‘children of the Windrush’. 
 
Throughout the multiple changes to immigration and nationality law enacted up to 2014, the nationality status of the ‘children of Windrush’ remained unchanged and unchallenged. As British citizens with full legal rights to live here, they put down roots, pursued careers, raised children and grandchildren and contributed in ways great and small to the creation of modern Britain. But with the introduction of the so-called ‘hostile environment’ legislation of 2014 and 2016, their situation changed. Though they were never the intended targets of the new laws, the hostile environment machine that evolved over the decade wasn’t designed to make allowances. Suddenly required to prove their status (due to the 1971 Act), Sarah, Anthony and Judy found themselves unable to show the levels of proof demanded by the new ‘hostile environment’ regulations. All three lost their jobs for up to two years and ran up debt trying to make ends meet. Anthony was arrested twice by Immigration Officers and held for weeks in detention centres. Then a ticket was bought to deport him to Jamaica, a country hadn’t seen since he left, aged eight, in 1965. ‘They broke me in there,’ Anthony says. ‘It was hard.’ Judy Griffith, still struggling to repay her debts, says: ‘It makes you question the whole, what is British? What is Britishness?’";History;BBC TWO;False;2019;59;signed, history, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p07jhxn0.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07jhxn0.jpg;david olusoga open secret government file show windrush scandal ‘ hostile environment ’ black british immigrant 70 year making film feature sarah ’ connor anthony bryan judy griffith settled legally since childhood reclassified illegal immigrant new ‘ hostile environment ’ regulation unable show proof nationality status lost job saving health facing deportation back country could barely remember david reveals today ’ scandal rooted secret past first windrush generation commonwealth citizen many exservicemen coming rebuild wartorn britain yet even arriving viewed government hostility civil servant mp warned dire consequence called ‘ coloured element ’ introduced uk pm clement attlee even suggested diverting windrush passenger east africa pick peanut government actively recruiting ten thousand white volunteer worker europe former member waffenss regiment stood accused war crime eastern front ‘ permanent settlement view intermarrying complete absorption working population ’ file expose successive british government spent next decade trying devise way prevent caribbean arrival without appearing discriminate pm winston churchill dissatisfied minister ’ response saw serious problem kept issue cabinet agenda special working party set gather information make political case immigration control two week queen ’ coronation head uk commonwealth secret race survey undertaken completed looking proof commonwealth immigrant burden welfare state chief constable major city asked ‘ coloured community whole particular section generally idle poor workman ’ ‘ addicted drugtrafficking type crime ’ working party found evidence view ‘ coloured community ’ le lawabiding hard working brit harold macmillan ’ government introduced 1962 immigration act control mechanism employment prospect wouldbe immigrant file show home secretary ‘ rab ’ butler described ‘ great merit ’ scheme ‘ presented making distinction ground race colour ’ would practice ‘ operate coloured people almost exclusively ’ time caribbean immigration shrunk fraction earlier level fearing restriction windrush generation arranged child come ‘ child windrush full legal right join parent uk many arrived little paperwork official record keeping successive government passed new immigration nationality legislation often response perceived ‘ problem ’ ‘ crisis ’ harold wilson rushed 1968 immigration act three day stop arrival thousand passportholding britishindians living kenya whose business livelihood threatened government edward heath ’ 1971 act tried restrict legal definition ‘ britishness ’ also placed burden proof claimant britishness challenged fateful clause ‘ child windrush ’ throughout multiple change immigration nationality law enacted 2014 nationality status ‘ child windrush ’ remained unchanged unchallenged british citizen full legal right live put root pursued career raised child grandchild contributed way great small creation modern britain introduction socalled ‘ hostile environment ’ legislation 2014 2016 situation changed though never intended target new law hostile environment machine evolved decade ’ designed make allowance suddenly required prove status due 1971 act sarah anthony judy found unable show level proof demanded new ‘ hostile environment ’ regulation three lost job two year ran debt trying make end meet anthony arrested twice immigration officer held week detention centre ticket bought deport jamaica country ’ seen since left aged eight 1965 ‘ broke ’ anthony say ‘ hard ’ judy griffith still struggling repay debt say ‘ make question whole british britishness ’;1

She speaks for the first time about her own sexual assault by a schoolboy, and asks what needs to change.;"Beginning with her own sexual assault, Zara investigates sexism and ‘rape culture’ in Britain. The assault left her with many unanswered questions. Why did it happen? Why did he think he could do it? And where did he learn that? Speaking to her friends, it quickly became clear that they all had their own stories - and many believe the problem starts at school.

In spring 2021, the website Everyone’s Invited was flooded with thousands of anonymous testimonies from schoolgirls sharing stories of sexual assault and harassment. An emergency Ofsted report confirmed that rape culture has been raging unchecked in our schools, and that urgent action is needed to tackle it. In this timely documentary, Zara speaks to young women and girls about their experience of rape culture. Exploring both state and private schools, Zara speaks to pupils to understand first-hand how these toxic behaviours happen.

Zara also meets young women who have been assaulted or raped by pupils at their school, finding out what action was taken by their schools while their cases were underway. One ex-pupil's perpetrator was allowed to remain in school alongside her during the trial and after his sentence was served. Another pupil tells Zara that she is too ashamed to tell her school and parents about her assault, fearing that no-one will believe her. And finally, Zara meets the friends and family of 12-year-old Semina Halliwell, who alleged she was raped by a boy from her school. She took her own life in June 2021. Her mum, Rachel, speaks about the devastation at the loss of her daughter and the rape culture on social media that she blames for Semina's tragic death.";Documentary;BBC THREE;Contains very strong language and upsetting scenes.;2021;58;signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0b3jbm6.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0b3jbm6.jpg;beginning sexual assault zara investigates sexism ‘ rape culture ’ britain assault left many unanswered question happen think could learn speaking friend quickly became clear story many believe problem start school spring 2021 website everyone ’ invited flooded thousand anonymous testimony schoolgirl sharing story sexual assault harassment emergency ofsted report confirmed rape culture raging unchecked school urgent action needed tackle timely documentary zara speaks young woman girl experience rape culture exploring state private school zara speaks pupil understand firsthand toxic behaviour happen zara also meet young woman assaulted raped pupil school finding action taken school case underway one expupils perpetrator allowed remain school alongside trial sentence served another pupil tell zara ashamed tell school parent assault fearing noone believe finally zara meet friend family 12yearold semina halliwell alleged raped boy school took life june 2021 mum rachel speaks devastation loss daughter rape culture social medium blame seminas tragic death;16

Seduced by the landscape, Miriam feels the stark divide between city and country folk and sees first-hand why they feel Trump is their man.

But the divisions don't stop there - Arkansas also has one of the highest concentrations of extreme race-hate groups in the US. A short drive from Dan and Peggy's, Miriam arrives in Harrison, once dubbed the most racist town in America. With historical links to the Ku Klux Klan, Miriam meets town residents who are determined to clear Harrison's unfortunate reputation. But despite the majority of people she meets helping to reassure her, a member of a local alt-right group also agrees to meet her. Due to his extreme anti-Semitic views, he refuses to be in the same room as Miriam but will answer her questions via a non-Jewish member of the production team. 

Upset and shaken by her encounter, Miriam begins to wonder just how united the United States is. Thankfully hope is on the horizon in neighbouring Texas, where she is buoyed by meeting the inspirational Zena Stephens, the state's first ever African-American female Sheriff, who is breaking down prejudice and hate in the divided city of Beaumont.

Still in Texas, one of the most religious states in the country, Miriam heads to stay with the Flanders, a devout Christian family. Doug and Jennifer have 12 children and believe the only way for the USA and the rest of the world to unite is through Christ. Atheist Miriam disagrees.

After nearly two months and over a thousand miles, Miriam's final destination is New Orleans for a thrilling meeting with the Caramel Curves - the city's all-female biker gang.

While his wife appears in Vogue magazine, the Syrian president must decide how to act as Arab Spring protests reach Syria's streets.;"Three-part series delving into the story of the Assad dynasty. Right at the centre of it are President Bashar and his wife Asma, who met and fell in love in London. Bashar al-Assad trained to be an eye doctor at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington and Asma was a British-born girl from a Syrian family with a career in investment banking. Over a decade ago, they were being welcomed with open arms in Britain. Today, they are entrenched in a brutal war that has led to some of the most horrifying crimes of modern times. Told through rarely seen footage and testimony of those who knew them, worked with them and studied them, the series explores how the couple, who at first were seen as a modernising force, ended up running a regime accused of war crimes.

The final episode gives the view from the presidential palace as the country descends into civil war, charting the moral lines crossed over the past seven years. Bashar al-Assad has been president of Syria for a decade, while his wife Asma is enjoying her role as first lady, pushing charity drives and encouraging schoolchildren to discuss democracy. As a glamorous profile of Asma appears in Vogue magazine, the Arab Spring protests reach Syria. Bashar must decide whether to concede to their demands for greater freedom or follow in his father Hafez's hard line steps. What unfolds shocks the world in its brutality.

It is a challenging balancing act. On the one hand, the Nazis must be mindful of President Paul von Hindenburg and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen, who are members of Germany’s traditional aristocratic ruling elite. On the other, there is the Nazis’ own power base – the stormtroopers - millions of angry, disenfranchised men who wreak havoc on German streets. 

The stormtroopers are led by Ernst Röhm, one of Hitler’s oldest and closest friends. Röhm wants Hitler to fulfil his promise to sweep away the traditional ruling class. Hitler owes Röhm: he has paved the way for Hitler’s political career, and his stormtroopers have helped to eradicate left-wing opposition to the Nazi Party. Now, though, they’re a potential threat - stormtrooper violence is undermining Hitler’s credibility as chancellor.  

In a bid to placate Röhm, Hitler makes him a minister, but Röhm tries to wrestle control of the existing army that reports to President Hindenburg, putting Hitler is in a difficult position, stuck between his president and his old friend.  

Röhm’s actions present Hermann Göring with an opportunity to persuade Hitler that his old comrade is no longer a friend, but a threat. But Göring will also need the help of his own rival, Heinrich Himmler. Himmler agrees to help destroy Röhm and his stormtroopers and make the SS Germany’s only paramilitary force.

In 2014, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger shot and stabbed six of his fellow students to death in a premeditated attack at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His motive? In a chilling video Rodger said he was angry that he was still a virgin and in his words wanted to show himself as 'the true alpha male' by punishing women for not being attracted to him.
 
The legacy of Rodger's assault catapulted online incels into wider consciousness. Incels - short for 'involuntary celibates' - are a global community of sexually frustrated young men, who have found support amongst one another on the net. Some idolise Rodger, and chillingly, his murder spree seems to have helped inspire at least three further mass killings in North America, that have mainly targeted women.  
 
At its extreme, incel ideology spreads violent misogyny, which blames women for depriving men of sex and relationships. Some forums have recorded up to 40,000 members and feature depraved ideas like state-sponsored rape and girlfriends. 
 
Following eight months of unprecedented access to incels, this documentary is the deepest exploration yet of this notoriously closed community. 
 
Told primarily through the personal stories of three men who identify as incels, the documentary explores how an online ideology can push young men into very disturbing behaviour. But the film also delves behind the sensationalist media headlines to unearth some of the reasons for incels' existence - many feel alienated and are enduring difficulties, like mental health issues, autism or traumatic upbringing.  

For some, the online forums are a haven to joke, vent and find support in a world where they are struggling to find an identity and where gender relations are changing dramatically.

Britain boldly presents itself as a beacon of racial tolerance, but with demonstrations sweeping the country, organisers believe that they are closer than ever to changing the way British institutions and individuals treat black people across the UK. There have been multiple campaigns for equality and justice for black British communities in the past, but none quite like this. 

The worldwide response to George Floyd’s death has given confidence to a new generation that this time could be different. The people behind the protests in Britain believe that they have the tools, allies, language and technology to create a new reality - but is this country ready to move beyond tolerance, to become an actively anti-racist society? The Windrush scandal, Grenfell and a recent resurgence in far-right terror plots have exposed fault lines across Britain. Now the graphic nature of George Floyd’s death is forcing us all to ask questions about the scale of racism in our communities and to explore what can be done to eliminate it for good.

But how had he got away with killing on such a scale for so long? 

Wilson explores the reaction to the staggering total, discovering how commentators came up with a range of theories to try to understand why a seemingly ordinary doctor had killed so many people.
 
Wilson meets a detective who led a team that questioned Shipman after his conviction about the murders he committed in Todmorden. He reveals how Shipman refused to utter a single word during several days of interrogation – a silence he maintained until he committed suicide in his prison cell, four years into multiple life sentences.

After seeing reports of Shipman’s suicide, a former nurse came forward. She recognised Shipman as a doctor she had worked with as a student nurse at a hospital in Pontefract, West Yorkshire. She had always been troubled by the number of deaths on one of the wards – a ward where she now realised Shipman had worked as a junior doctor. Could he have begun killing there, even before he became a GP?

Wilson tracks down a family whose elderly relative died whilst under Shipman’s care in hospital in Pontefract, as well as another doctor who worked alongside Shipman there. Piecing together their stories, Wilson reveals that not only is it clear that Shipman had begun killing before he qualified as a GP, it is also very likely that Shipman killed at least one child. 
 
The revelation that Shipman had begun killing even before he became a GP and that some of his victims were children is shocking. At the time, the coverage of these revelations differed markedly to the reporting of the deaths of hundreds of Shipman’s elderly victims in Hyde. Wilson asks if these contrasting responses can be explained by the victims’ ages and if that could explain why Shipman targeted mainly elderly patients – not because he was driven by a compulsion to kill old people, but because he knew he would be more likely to get away with it.
 
Wilson interrogates his own preconceptions about the Shipman case - he had wrongly assumed that Hyde was a town with an above average elderly population and had pictured Shipman’s victims as frail, decrepit, housebound old ladies, when in truth they were mostly fit, active members of their community. Wilson concludes that these preconceptions run through the entire Shipman case, informing an attitude and prejudice towards the elderly that allowed a seemingly ordinary GP to get away with murdering hundreds of people, in plain sight, for nearly 30 years.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains upsetting scenes.;2020;59;signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p08sjpc0.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p08sjpc0.jpg;episode open publication first report public inquiry death shipman ’ patient report officially concluded working gp harold shipman murdered 260 patient got away killing scale long wilson explores reaction staggering total discovering commentator came range theory try understand seemingly ordinary doctor killed many people wilson meet detective led team questioned shipman conviction murder committed todmorden reveals shipman refused utter single word several day interrogation – silence maintained committed suicide prison cell four year multiple life sentence seeing report shipman ’ suicide former nurse came forward recognised shipman doctor worked student nurse hospital pontefract west yorkshire always troubled number death one ward – ward realised shipman worked junior doctor could begun killing even became gp wilson track family whose elderly relative died whilst shipman ’ care hospital pontefract well another doctor worked alongside shipman piecing together story wilson reveals clear shipman begun killing qualified gp also likely shipman killed least one child revelation shipman begun killing even became gp victim child shocking time coverage revelation differed markedly reporting death hundred shipman ’ elderly victim hyde wilson asks contrasting response explained victim ’ age could explain shipman targeted mainly elderly patient – driven compulsion kill old people knew would likely get away wilson interrogates preconception shipman case wrongly assumed hyde town average elderly population pictured shipman ’ victim frail decrepit housebound old lady truth mostly fit active member community wilson concludes preconception run entire shipman case informing attitude prejudice towards elderly allowed seemingly ordinary gp get away murdering hundred people plain sight nearly 30 year;1

The service has so far managed to vaccinate 70 per cent of its frontline workforce.

A quiet start to the night shift is broken by a 999 call on behalf of a 13-year-old patient who is stuck on a bus having dislocated her knee. She is unable to move and in severe pain, so the crew have no choice but to try to get the knee back in place at the scene. 

Across the city, crewmates Adam and Charlotte respond to a call for a patient who is struggling to breathe. As Covid-19 has already affected the patient's family, the crew have no choice but to take them to hospital. Another patient with breathing difficulties is reluctant to go to hospital for fear of catching the virus there. However, Covid-related deaths in the UK are at their lowest since December, and call volumes to the service are also down. 

Later, Adam and Charlotte are dispatched to a patient who is lapsing in and out of consciousness. When they arrive on scene, they suspect the patient may have suffered a stroke.

Can he make the leap from mild-mannered hotel manager to prize fighter?;"Senior director Kris always goes above and beyond the call of duty, and now owner Lawrence has asked him to do something completely out of his comfort zone - fight in a charity boxing match being held at the hotel. Kris is not a fan of boxing and is hesitant to take on the challenge, but the proceeds will go to the homeless shelter that Lawrence set up when he kept finding rough sleepers in the hotel car park. To raise cash, Lawrence will also fight, but his wife Katie isn’t keen on seeing her husband in the ring. 

Meanwhile, VIP guest Louise Brookes has checked in. She has stayed at the hotel more than 175 times and always requests room 118, but there is a problem with the room, so the staff race to repair the damage. The reason for Louise’s attachment to the room is because it became like home for her when she stayed for many months while attending the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster. Her brother was one of the 96 who died in the tragedy, and during her stay Louise lights a candle for him at the permanent memorial to the victims in reception. 

Weddings are an important revenue generator for the hotel, and despite her chaotic approach, wedding planner Ciara organises up to four weddings per week. But bookings are down for next year, so Ciara launches a new competition called Runaway Bride to promote weddings at the hotel.

Doorman Eric has his hands full at the hotel welcoming a very different sort of guest - 100 pensioners for a ballroom dancing event. Eighty-three-year-old Jerry still likes to stay light on his feet, and when hotel owner Katie’s mum shows up, he tries to make her feel at home.

Now he has decided it is finally time to learn.;"Jay Blades, presenter of The Repair Shop, has decided it’s finally time to learn to read. He has been told he has the reading age of an 11-year-old. Throughout his life he has found ways of avoiding the written word, and this film digs deep into how this has shaped him.

Blades left school with no qualifications and nothing to his name than a reputation as a great fighter. Can he now, in mid-life, tackle what he failed to learn the first time round?

He’s not alone in facing this issue. Research findings suggest that a quarter of all children in England leave primary school, like Blades, unable to read to the expected level. More than eight million adults in the UK have poor literacy skills, and half of all prisoners either can’t read or struggle to do so.

Using a system developed for use in prisons by the Shannon Trust, Jay commits to learn to read with Read Easy, a charity whose volunteers do one-to-one coaching. Along the way, he revisits key moments in his life that were shaped by not being able to read: the ‘learner’ class at school, the dead-end jobs he had to take because he had no qualifications, and not being able to read his children bedtime stories. Daughter Zola is now 15, and Jay wants to read her a story before she reaches adulthood on her next birthday.

Following Jay over six months of learning, this intimate and revealing film goes behind closed doors to see how he organizes his upholstery business without the written word, manages on The Repair Shop without scripts and struggles each day with his vowels and consonants as he tries to learn phonics. We meet Jay’s girlfriend Lisa, his daughter Zola and his ‘adopted’ family who all help him with his reading challenge.

In this fourth leg of the journey, Simon travels through Texas and down the length of Mexico. In Texas, Simon joins the US Border Patrol, who constantly pick up migrants who have illegally crossed the dangerous Rio Grande river in search of a new life in the United States. In the midst of this humanitarian crisis, Simon meets one woman who risks her life to take vital supplies across the border to stranded migrants on the Mexican side of the border in one of the most violent cities in Mexico. Much of the city of Reynosa is in the grip of a powerful criminal organisation, the Gulf Cartel. Simon visits the elite police force tasked with taking on an enemy that uses high-tech surveillance and an arsenal of US-manufactured weapons to control the border city.

In southern Mexico, Simon visits Chiapas, a state with spectacular scenery, culture and history. Chiapas is also home to the largest indigenous population in Mexico, who trace their ancestry to the ancient Mayans. In the depths of the rainforest, Simon explores the Mayan city of Yaxchilan, once a thriving hub of a hugely sophisticated civilisation that prospered long before European settlers arrived in the Americas. Simon discovers that today’s indigenous communities have been marginalised, and many complain they are treated as second-class citizens in Mexico. Until the middle of the 20th century, the Lacandon people had little contact with the outside world.

Londoner Pablo Henderson is first to arrive, with his late father’s defunct record turntable. His father arrived in the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s and loved music. The turntable would provide the sweet sounds of reggae music for the huge sound system that Pablo’s father set up at neighbourhood parties. Electronics expert Mark Stuckey gets the dilapidated deck back in tip-top condition once again, while Will Kirk crafts an impressive plinth to house it.

Andy Matthews and his daughter Anna have brought in a stately chair for the attention of Will and upholsterer Sonnaz Nooranvary. The chair was made specially for King George VI's coronation ceremony, which Andy’s grandfather attended as an usher. The chair was presented to him as a token of appreciation and has been a source of great pride for their family. However, 90 years have taken their toll on the piece. The wooden frame is unstable, and the velvet fabric is faded and threadbare in places. Together, Will and Sonnaz give it the restoration it deserves.

Wendy Bray is a woman on a mission. She would love leather expert Susie Fletcher to repair and revitalise her late mother’s writing case. Wendy’s mother was a remarkable woman who, during the Second World War, worked as a code breaker at Bletchley Park. She was a keen letter writer, and the case was with her always. Wendy would like to preserve the now-tattered case and pass it on to her daughter and granddaughter, through four generations or wonderful women. 

And last but not least, Cathy Downie has brought in a beloved mechanical toy clown. It was a gift from her dear Uncle Jimmy, with whom she spent many happy times as a child. She has treasured the acrobatic clown for decades, even though it has been broken for many of them.

With anxiety sky-high, in a sport that demands perfection, the mounting pressure proves too much for some.

After narrowly missing out on making the squad last season – by a crushing 0.01 of a point – Emily Hayward is on a mission to ensure this year she makes the grade. To compete with the elite squad, Emily will have to nail her triple jumps, but she suffers a setback when a training session goes wrong. Also hoping to earn a spot on the Performance Squad is 20-year-old skater Eleanor. She has just stepped up from the less pressurised Junior category, and this will be her first competition as a fully fledged Senior competitor.

After failing to impress British Ice Skating judges, ice dance duo Anthony and Eleanor are back in action and more determined than ever to prove to the establishment they are capable of representing GB abroad. Anthony learns a valuable lesson as he grapples with his perfectionist attitude and tries to tame his often cruel inner voice.

America was under attack. President George W Bush was sitting in front of seven-year-olds in a classroom in Florida. Members of the president’s security detail thought the next plane could be aimed at them. 

A first draft of history and a claustrophobic clock-ticking thriller, this film tells the story of the presidency on arguably the most consequential day in recent history. How should a government deal with a large scale terrorist attack that used four commercial aircraft as missiles? How would they cope with losing their friends? And how could they respond? 

As the clock ticks, the administration make the greatest decisions of their lives: should they order fighter jets to shoot on American civilians? Should the president declare war or calm a battered nation? How would the leadership of the most powerful nation on earth grapple with the national and international implications?

The film starts with the story of one of France’s most celebrated novelists and poets, Victor Hugo. After falling foul of the French emperor, Louis Napoleon, Hugo fled to the island of Guernsey. Here, he created some of the most haunting images of the romantic age, thousands of drawings plucked from his restless, melancholy mind. 

Long before Sigmund Freud and the invention of modern psychoanalysis, it is often forgotten that it was the romantics who became the first intrepid explorers of the deepest, darkest corners of the human mind. At the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, Simon traces the origins of this revolution to the prints of Giambattista Piranesi. His series of Imaginary Prisons are the first images of the inner visions of the mind, and they have had a long-lasting influence in our modern world - not least in modern cinema. 

Among those inspired by Piranesi's images was poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge and, later, one of his disciples, journalist, writer and wannabe-poet Thomas de Quincey. Both of them used opium to open up ‘the apocalypse of the world within’. Simon tells the story of how both artists changed the way we think about the human mind.

Simon then looks at how the romantics changed the way we think about madness. In their craving for deeper experiences, very few romantics - at one stage or other - didn’t think they were going mad. 

One, however, found a way to avoid the fate of so many his colleagues and friends: William Wordsworth. He was equally interested in the mapping and exploration of his own mind, but he also realised that it was by attaching it to something bigger that he could escape the irrational forces of darkness and self-obsession that threatened to overwhelm him. Meeting Sir David Attenborough, who also reads lines from Tintern Abbey and Wordsworth’s The Tables Turned, Simon asks whether we need to heed the lessons of the romantics before it is too late.

He investigates why a new trade border in the Irish Sea has led to violent protests, sparking fear among some of a return to conflict, nearly 25 years after the end of the Troubles; a conflict which claimed thousands of lives, including that of his father Jack Kielty.

In this very personal film, Patrick’s focus is on a new generation born long after the ceasefire, as he tries to understand what is driving this new wave of unrest, particularly in Loyalist communities. He also explores why some feel that a united Ireland could now be on the horizon and how the trauma of Northern Ireland’s past is shaping its future.

This is the next stage in the family’s journey following the Bafta- award winning and critically acclaimed 2017 documentary, ‘Rio Ferdinand: Being Mum and Dad’.
 
Two years after Rebecca’s passing, Rio also lost his mum, Janet, to cancer. So in the months leading up to their wedding, this deeply personal film will look at the emotionally complicated dilemmas this newly formed family unit face following the family’s double bereavement.
 
For 27 year old Kate, taking on not only the role as Rio’s new partner, but also of ‘mum’ to three grieving children, and with the memory of Rebecca and Janet still very much present, a unique set of emotionally complicated challenges emerge.
 
Stepfamilies are now the fastest growing family type in the UK. It's estimated that 1 in 3 of all families are now blended families. 

In search of answers, Kate and Rio meet other step-parents willing to share their experiences at one of the support groups on offer, Happy Steps, led by Professor Lisa Doodson, a chartered psychologist specialising in stepfamily dynamics. 
 
As Rio and Kate open up about their own experiences, they learn they’re not alone and that stepfamilies often have to overcome challenges when developing their new family units which can affect their mental wellbeing, with increased stress and anxiety, particularly for stepmums.
 
But whilst Rio and Kate start to explore some of their own questions around step-parenting, they still aren’t sure how the three children are coping with the loss of both grandmother Janet and their mum Rebecca. 
 
On visiting a specialist child bereavement charity, Rio and Kate hear from other children who have lost a parent and now have a new step-parent in their lives. Listening to the powerful advice from these young people, Rio realises that he’s working too hard, and that Kate probably spends more time with the kids than he does.

Before he found fame on an international level, British comedy was an end-of-the-pier kind of affair - but through sheer talent and force of personality, Connolly ploughed a different and deeply personal yet universal approach to comedy and in doing so he changed the face of British comedy forever.

He has been called the Beatles and Jesus of comedy by his peers and an immature 'manure mouth' by the leader of the Scottish Zion Baptist Church. So say what you like about him, but you can't deny everyone wants to know him. And that is what Made In Scotland is about - it is Billy as you have never seen him before - intimate, deeply personal and very funny.

Weaved around personal accounts and interviews from famous faces, Billy's life is revealed in all its glory - a shaggy dog story approach to his work - and one that has turned him from Billy Connolly the welder into Billy Connolly - The Big Yin.

They were working hard and counting on providing better opportunities and education for their children. However, in a white-dominated country, where the politics were becoming increasingly racialised, there was a question of how society, and its teachers, saw these young black children.

Before having a chance to develop intellectually, they were labelled as stupid, difficult and disruptive. The paradox is that many of the new migrants to Britain were in fact highly educated. One of them was Gus John, who arrived from Trinidad as a Dominican novitiate to become a priest. Almost immediately he was contacted by some black parents worried about the schooling of their children. Together with several other educators, John quickly realised that the system was not just inept, but actually rigged against black children.
 
At the same time, celebrity psychologists Hans Eysenck and Arthur Jensen were propounding theories that black people were genetically less intelligent than white people. These theories infiltrated teacher training and found their way into schools.

It is the story of an extraordinary man, an English, World Cup-winning legend who became an Irish hero.

Jack Charlton won the World Cup in 1966 playing alongside his brother, Bobby, in England’s greatest ever side. A proud Englishman, Jack applied for only one job in his subsequent career as a football manager: the England job. Jack never received a reply from the FA. Instead, he accepted an invitation to manage the Republic of Ireland, and took on a side that had never qualified for a major tournament to the dizzying heights of a World Cup quarter-final.

In doing so he inspired a nation. Ireland’s footballing success represented far more than winning matches, it influenced a social and cultural change in a country that faced deep-seated political and economic challenges.

Finding Jack Charlton tells the story of Jack’s special association with Ireland and also examines his frustration with England and the FA, his complicated relationship with his brother Sir Bobby Charlton, and his final battle with dementia.

Offering an intimate, compelling insight into Jack the man, Finding Jack Charlton includes contributions from Jack’s family, his wife Pat and son John, alongside celebrated Irish players, musicians, writers and politicians, including Larry Mullen Jr, Roddy Doyle, Brendan O’Carroll, Paul McGrath, Niall Quinn, Mick McCarthy, David O’Leary and Andy Townsend.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains some strong language.;2021;95;signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09bnzmf.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09bnzmf.jpg;finding jack charlton compelling emotional definitive portrait football life like story extraordinary man english world cupwinning legend became irish hero jack charlton world cup 1966 playing alongside brother bobby england ’ greatest ever side proud englishman jack applied one job subsequent career football manager england job jack never received reply fa instead accepted invitation manage republic ireland took side never qualified major tournament dizzying height world cup quarterfinal inspired nation ireland ’ footballing success represented far winning match influenced social cultural change country faced deepseated political economic challenge finding jack charlton tell story jack ’ special association ireland also examines frustration england fa complicated relationship brother sir bobby charlton final battle dementia offering intimate compelling insight jack man finding jack charlton includes contribution jack ’ family wife pat son john alongside celebrated irish player musician writer politician including larry mullen jr roddy doyle brendan ’ carroll paul mcgrath niall quinn mick mccarthy david ’ leary andy townsend;7

On 9 October 1986, nine-year-old friends Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows went out to play and didn't come home. The whole estate turned out to look for the two girls only to have their hopes dashed when they were found lying dead in undergrowth in Wild Park, on the outskirts of Brighton. Both had been strangled and sexually assaulted.

For their families it was the start of a living hell. Police arrested a man the girls liked and trusted - 20-year-old Russell Bishop - and in 1987 he was put on trial. But the jury took less than two hours to acquit him of the murders. Under the law at the time, Bishop could not be retried even if new evidence were to be found. The families of the murdered girls had to endure years of agony, without any prospect of justice for their lost children. Until 2005, when the double jeopardy law was abolished, rekindling the hopes of the families.

Now police and scientists are using cutting-edge methods to uncover new evidence, which they hope will be enough for the CPS to pursue a fresh prosecution. Following the reinvestigation and proceedings from an early stage, and sharing the experience of the children's families, this film charts the last chance at finally finding justice for Karen and Nicola.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains some strong language.;2019;59;signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p06w5ppj.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p06w5ppj.jpg;exclusive documentary follows culmination 32year fight justice notorious unsolved double child murder 9 october 1986 nineyearold friend karen hadaway nicola fellow went play didnt come home whole estate turned look two girl hope dashed found lying dead undergrowth wild park outskirt brighton strangled sexually assaulted family start living hell police arrested man girl liked trusted 20yearold russell bishop 1987 put trial jury took le two hour acquit murder law time bishop could retried even new evidence found family murdered girl endure year agony without prospect justice lost child 2005 double jeopardy law abolished rekindling hope family police scientist using cuttingedge method uncover new evidence hope enough cps pursue fresh prosecution following reinvestigation proceeding early stage sharing experience childrens family film chart last chance finally finding justice karen nicola;11

The hotel restaurant isn't doing well and the five-star Corinthia needs a big-name chef to compete with its rivals. Tom Kerridge, the British chef most famous for his two Michelin-starred restaurants in Marlow, 28 miles outside of London, takes on the job. His acclaimed traditional British upmarket fish and chips aren't the usual fare for a five-star hotel, and it is his first restaurant in London. It is a family enterprise - his artist wife Beth is providing sculptures to enhance the space. 

It is not enough to wait and see if the clients come for the new food and art. Thomas makes an annual pilgrimage to Las Vegas to a five-star trade convention with 6,000 delegates. He has to sell the hotel, competing with other London and global brands, to American luxury travel agents in hundreds of four-minute meetings. It is exhausting work in 110 degrees in crazy Vegas.

One of the hotel's penthouses costs an eye-watering £22k a night. Some guests choose to stay in the hotel for several months and clients' bills can reach £3 million. At those prices, in such a competitive market, Thomas can never stand still. There is always more to be done to cater for his super-rich clientele.

Oli, 21, lives in London and has two mums, who conceived him using an anonymous sperm donor in California. Oli always knew he was donor conceived but is curious about his biology.

Then she drops the real bombshell: Oli has 25 American half brothers and sisters. 
 
Oli virtually meets his new extended family, who are excited about the latest addition to their network. Within days, their online relationship becomes strained, as Oli’s strong opinions clash with those of his siblings. Oli was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome aged 12.

This vivid and moving film for BBC Two collates the memories of survivors, the bereaved, firefighters, safety experts and the politicians linked to five intensely fierce fire disasters that preceded Grenfell. This telling collection of interviews and archive footage shows the clear warnings that existed and could have predicted a Grenfell-type inferno happening in Britain.

The programme focuses on three factors: the application of flammable material and cladding to buildings, the 'stay put' advice given by fire services, the absence of sprinklers - and how they contributed to each of the previous five blazes, sometimes with fatal consequences. Made over the course of 12 months, the film tells the story of the legislative history of building regulations from 1973 to the present day through five fires. It explores the causes, subsequent investigations and the recommendations that were sent to successive UK governments, ultimately posing the question: if lessons had been learned as a result of tragic repetition of errors over the decades, could Grenfell have been avoided?

The five fires revisited include the Summerland disaster, Douglas, Isle of Man (1973), Knowsley Heights fire, Liverpool (1991), Garnock Court fire, Irvine, N Ayrshire (1999), Harrow Court fire, Stevenage, Herts (2005), and Lakanal House, London (2009).";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains upsetting scenes.;2018;59;signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p0b57rmz.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p0b57rmz.jpg;60minute documentary dramatic haunting story five fire foretold grenfell disaster told eye directly involved vivid moving film bbc two collates memory survivor bereaved firefighter safety expert politician linked five intensely fierce fire disaster preceded grenfell telling collection interview archive footage show clear warning existed could predicted grenfelltype inferno happening britain programme focus three factor application flammable material cladding building stay put advice given fire service absence sprinkler contributed previous five blaze sometimes fatal consequence made course 12 month film tell story legislative history building regulation 1973 present day five fire explores cause subsequent investigation recommendation sent successive uk government ultimately posing question lesson learned result tragic repetition error decade could grenfell avoided five fire revisited include summerland disaster douglas isle man 1973 knowsley height fire liverpool 1991 garnock court fire irvine n ayrshire 1999 harrow court fire stevenage herts 2005 lakanal house london 2009;1

In his role of Ranger he shows us around the Windsor estate, and describes what it was like when he first arrived in 1952: how he transformed the castle inside and out; how he handled the old guard; his biggest bug-bear, the tree-huggers; his successes and (very messy) failures as an ecopioneer; how he turned Windsor into a home fit for a young and growing family; what is was like following in the footsteps of his predecessor and ancestor Prince Albert; he tells us about his love of polo and the real reason he built a polo club on the grounds, and how he wrote the rules for carriage-driving- the sport he never gave up. And he even touches on his own place in history, and his firm belief that it is for others to decide his legacy… There is relaxed banter with the film crew, funny off-camera exchanges (which we include), but there are also serious and at times some very poignant and reflective moments. And all this at the place he calls home-which of course will be his final resting place too.

On one side were Barry Hearn’s ‘Matchroom Mob’, including Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis: clean-living, utterly professional and family friendly. In sharp contrast was a group that included Alex Higgins, Jimmy White and Kirk Stevens, who all embraced a more rock-and-roll lifestyle.

With Higgins’s career quickly spiralling out of control, Jimmy White was next in line to take the crown of ‘people’s champion’. But Jimmy also had an insatiable appetite for the highlife and a string of vices – including cocaine and crack - that threatened to overshadow his raw talent and enormous potential.

Twelve years younger than Alex, Jimmy soon realised that Alex’s popularity and ability was at odds with his success in the game, having won only two world championship trophies in a sport many thought he should dominate. Indeed, Steve Davis had quickly become the world number one through practice and discipline and had suddenly become the man to beat. Desperate for success and tempted by the lucrative rewards brought by towing the line, Jimmy joined Barry Hearn in the hope he could be turned into a champion like his new stablemate, Steve Davis.

Jimmy began the 90s clean and well-prepared and got his best opportunity yet to win his first world championship, coming up against a young emerging Scotsman called Stephen Hendry. With White as the hot favourite and with the crowd urging him on, the 1990 final turned out to be a pivotal moment in British snooker and paved the way for what was to come in the next decade.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains very strong language.;2021;59;signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09gkj03.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09gkj03.jpg;mid80s snooker biggest sport country two distinct camp emerged amongst player one side barry hearn ’ ‘ matchroom mob ’ including dennis taylor steve davis cleanliving utterly professional family friendly sharp contrast group included alex higgins jimmy white kirk stevens embraced rockandroll lifestyle higgins ’ career quickly spiralling control jimmy white next line take crown ‘ people ’ champion ’ jimmy also insatiable appetite highlife string vice – including cocaine crack threatened overshadow raw talent enormous potential twelve year younger alex jimmy soon realised alex ’ popularity ability odds success game two world championship trophy sport many thought dominate indeed steve davis quickly become world number one practice discipline suddenly become man beat desperate success tempted lucrative reward brought towing line jimmy joined barry hearn hope could turned champion like new stablemate steve davis jimmy began 90 clean wellprepared got best opportunity yet win first world championship coming young emerging scotsman called stephen hendry white hot favourite crowd urging 1990 final turned pivotal moment british snooker paved way come next decade;11

A series of investigations found it was suicide. Her family dispute this and believe that they’ve been denied justice.;"Bollywood actor Jiah Khan was found dead in her flat in 2013.

Jiah Khan’s family say the investigation was incomplete. Judges granted Rabia Khan two new investigations, first by the Mumbai Police, then by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Both concluded Jiah had died by suicide and was driven to it by her boyfriend. Jiah’s family commissioned a legal case review from a British law firm. It concluded there were faults with the investigations from the night she died onwards. Vital evidence might have been missed.

The film also explores Jiah’s early experiences in films as a teenager. She was typecast as ‘bold’ after starring in a version of Lolita. She worked with individuals later accused of sexual harassment during the Bollywood #metoo movement after her death. They deny wrongdoing.

Her boyfriend, charged with driving her to suicide, denies this, arguing that Jiah was under pressure from a young age and suffered mental health problems before they met. Her family say she was resilient and had much to look forward to in her career.

The police and CBI declined to take part in the series or to respond to allegations.

Brown finally becomes Prime Minister, only to face crisis after crisis.;"In 2005, Labour’s General Election campaign was fought against the backdrop of the Iraq War. Tony Blair and New Labour are in a precarious position. Popularity ratings are low and, to top it off, the relationship between Blair and chancellor Gordon Brown has hit rock bottom. In order to win a third term in office, they agree to put their differences aside and form a united front.

The display of unity works, and New Labour wins for a third time. But a new question looms over the government. Tony Blair had agreed with Gordon Brown that he wouldn’t serve a full third term as Prime Minister. As Brown’s allies press the Prime Minister for a departure date, Blair has a change of heart. He feels that more needed to be done before he could step aside, and he isn’t convinced that Brown will fulfil New Labour’s modernising agenda. To Brown’s surprise and frustration, Blair tells the press he will be staying on as leader.

The 'coup' that follows is a bubbling over of tensions within the Labour government. Blair had lost the support of many Labour MPs over Iraq, and the apparent U-turn over his departure sparked outrage among the Brownites, who felt it was high time for Blair to go. 

After being pushed into announcing a departure date, Tony Blair steps down as prime minister on 27 June 2007. Gordon Brown is finally able to take the reins. But leading the country is very different to leading the Treasury, and a series of crises put the dampeners on any agenda Brown wants to put forward. His popularity dives further when he fails to call an election. Then, just months after taking office, a global financial crash threatens to destroy economies across the world. 

We tell the story of how Gordon Brown reacted to the economic crisis, bringing together world leaders and trying to save the global economy. Despite this, the public turn against the Brown government, and in 2010, after 13 years in power, New Labour is finally forced out of office.";Documentary;BBC TWO;False;2021;59;signed, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09xhhnw.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09xhhnw.jpg;2005 labour ’ general election campaign fought backdrop iraq war tony blair new labour precarious position popularity rating low top relationship blair chancellor gordon brown hit rock bottom order win third term office agree put difference aside form united front display unity work new labour win third time new question loom government tony blair agreed gordon brown ’ serve full third term prime minister brown ’ ally press prime minister departure date blair change heart feel needed done could step aside ’ convinced brown fulfil new labour ’ modernising agenda brown ’ surprise frustration blair tell press staying leader coup follows bubbling tension within labour government blair lost support many labour mp iraq apparent uturn departure sparked outrage among brownites felt high time blair go pushed announcing departure date tony blair step prime minister 27 june 2007 gordon brown finally able take rein leading country different leading treasury series crisis put dampener agenda brown want put forward popularity dive fails call election month taking office global financial crash threatens destroy economy across world tell story gordon brown reacted economic crisis bringing together world leader trying save global economy despite public turn brown government 2010 13 year power new labour finally forced office;11

Peter and George were close friends with the non-Jewish sons of their building's caretaker, Mr Schadler, and the four boys would play football together. But as the Nazi party steadily increased persecution against Jews, life for the family became very difficult. On Kristallnacht in November 1938, when thousands of Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps, Mr Schadler hid the twins' father Franz in the basement at great risk to his own safety. The following year, with just days to spare before the outbreak of war, Mr Schadler lent the family money to escape Berlin by train and come to London. Now 87 years old, Peter and George would love to reunite with their childhood friends and thank them for the great sacrifice their father made to ensure their family’s safety.
 
We also tell the story of Clare, who took in 21 refugee children - many of whom she was told were orphans - from war torn Bosnia. The local community in Elgin, Scotland rallied round to welcome them, but it was only when international schoolgirl Petra came to translate that the children were able to properly communicate and share what horrors they had fled. Petra not only gave the refugees a voice, but crucially she also uncovered the truth – that none of them were orphans and all had families they had been forced to leave behind.

Despite the efforts of the redeployed miners, winter conditions mean they haven’t been able to finish creating a flat platform on the hillside for building to start.

As February comes to a close the weather starts to improve and there is a chance to claw back lost time. However, the pandemic then hits the UK and on 23 March the country goes into lockdown, meaning the site has to be closed.

Four miles away in the usually bustling village of Tyndrum, everything is quiet, and owner of The Real Food Café, Sarah, is concerned about the large elderly population in the area, which includes her mum. Green Welly Stop owner Fiona continues to provide essential fuel supplies, but she has had to put 60 staff on furlough.

Up at the mine, the small team working on care and maintenance have been able to finally finish preparing the base for the processing plant. There is also the positive news that the price of gold has reached an all-time high and the company is now in a good financial position, despite all the delays.

At the start of July, the Scottish government’s five-mile travel restriction is lifted and local businesses are able to open. However, Andy at the Tyndrum Inn is worried they won’t make it through the winter, while at The Real Food Café, Sarah explains they are approaching a half a million-pound loss due to missing out on four of their most profitable months.

Detective Chief Inspector John Bent is proud of his record of solving all the murders he has investigated, but the odds are stacked against him on his latest case, a fire that resulted in one death but could have led to mass fatalities. The evidence has gone up in smoke, there is no CCTV footage, and community tensions mean witnesses aren’t coming forward. Meanwhile, Sergeant Phil Hamlani and his neighbourhood team have gathered enough intelligence to raid the address of a suspected drug dealer, but they are aware that there is potential danger behind every door. 

Elsewhere, another life is under threat. A grade one call comes in from paramedics who are being obstructed from carrying out CPR. Response officers Mark and Sarah rush to the scene, but the person has fled the scene, a drugs den. Despite the paramedics’ best efforts, the victim is pronounced dead.

It stopped all traffic in one of the most important shipping lanes in the world for almost a week, causing a ‘ship jam’ of over 300 vessels and delaying deliveries of billions of pounds of vital food, fuel and medical supplies.

The external cladding was found to be the primary cause of the rapid spread of the fire. What followed was a reassessment of fire safety on high-rise buildings across the UK.

Today, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in tower blocks wrapped in dangerous, flammable materials, and are now facing eye-watering bills to make their properties safe. Some have already declared bankruptcy.

BBC business correspondent Sarah Corker and producer/director James Stewart investigate the severe financial and mental health impact on those trapped in dangerous homes and explore the root causes of this spiralling scandal. They reveal that those who bought through the government’s affordable housing schemes, often first-time buyers on low incomes, are now facing demands of tens of thousands of pounds.

What does his arrest say about the changing adult industry?;"

For decades, the world’s most famous male porn star, Ron Jeremy, allegedly groped, assaulted and raped women.

One of the most unlikely success stories of the adult industry, Jeremy, 68, became an ‘icon’ of porn who appeared in over 2,000 adult movies and successfully crossed over into mainstream media.

Yet it wasn’t until June 2020 that he was arrested and charged with 34 sex crimes against 21 women. He is currently in prison awaiting trial.

This explosive documentary hears for the first time from some of his alleged victims as well as those who helped raise the alarm about him.

Ginger Banks, one of the first adult performers to shine a spotlight on Ron Jeremy’s behaviour, speaks about her struggle to get the industry to take action.

She says she fought to get Jeremy banned from adult expos and events where he was allegedly assaulting many of his victims. Was the industry turning a blind eye to what Ron was apparently doing? Jeremy – who has consistently denied all the allegations against him and has pleaded not guilty to all the charges – faces up to 330 years in prison if convicted.

Despite the allegations, he still has many supporters. Some friends and former colleagues believe Jeremy has become the #MeToo fall guy for the adult industry.

Conversations about consent have become more sophisticated in recent years, and in the world of porn setting boundaries on set is more important than ever before.

This documentary gains unfettered access behind the scenes of the often secretive adult world and questions what Ron Jeremy’s arrest says about the changing industry.

It was Italy’s worst ever road-bridge disaster. This film tells the story of some of the people on the bridge that day and investigates what caused the bridge to fail so catastrophically.  

The Polcevera Bridge was an icon of 1960s engineering, built by one of Italy’s most celebrated engineers, and hailed by some as a masterpiece. It formed a vital link in the main motorway between the south of France and Rome. Its failure had a huge impact on the local economy. The debris blocked railway lines for weeks, 600 people who lived under the bridge were forced to flee their homes, and lorry drivers had to make a 115km detour.

At that moment I let go of the wheel, I placed my hands behind my head, and I thought I was already dead.""

Boris Johnson came to power promising to deliver Brexit 'do or die' by 31 October. He didn't achieve it and instead, the public were asked to vote in a general election that would decide if Brexit is delivered or if a second referendum should take place.

This film gains unique access to the prime minister, his cabinet and leading politicians who oppose him for a film that records up close the decisions and drama that unfolds as the deadline to Brexit day looms.

The story begins as Boris Johnson is elected leader of the Conservative party and with it becomes prime minister of the United Kingdom. The film follows his efforts over the summer to secure a deal with the European Union, who had previously refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement. Along the way, dramatic twists and turns in the story look set to block Boris Johnson's path for delivering on his promise to 'get Brexit done'.

A Supreme Court ruling decided that his decision to prorogue parliament was unlawful. A cross-party group of MPs work together to form a 'remain alliance' and pass legislation that requires Boris Johnson to ask for a Brexit extension, and the Labour party ultimately decides to vote to allow a general election to take place. 

Throughout these events, MPs from all sides of the argument reveal their candid thoughts on the strategies they are pursuing and the pressures they face from an increasingly frustrated and divided electorate.

Made by award-winning documentary maker Olly Lambert, One Day in Gaza examines, moment by moment, what happened on that fateful day.
 
14 May 2018 started as a day of mass protest at Gaza’s border with Israel, and would end as one of the most deadly days in Gaza for a generation. For weeks, Palestinians had been protesting along the border fence, but tensions were running particularly high due to the opening of the new United States embassy to Israel in Jerusalem - the controversial step ordered by Donald Trump. As Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and other senior US officials gathered in Jerusalem to inaugurate the new embassy, tens of thousands of Palestinians gathered at sites along the Gaza border, barely 40 miles away. As the sun set that day, over 60 Palestinians were dead or dying, and over two thousand lay injured, many by live ammunition. 
 
Drawing on more than 120 hours of archive footage filmed on both sides of the border that day - including exclusive videos released by both Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that dominates Gaza, and the Israel Defense Forces, this film reveals the complex reality and human toll of the day, and asks who is to blame for the bloodshed. It also features exclusive interviews with senior commanders and intelligence officers from the Israel Defense Forces, as well as political leaders of both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant group, and civilians who were present on both sides of the border. What really happened that day? Israel said its troops only opened fire in self-defence or on people using the protests as cover for an armed infiltration, while Palestinians and human rights groups have accused Israeli troops of using excessive force against unarmed civilians who posed no threat. This 60-minute film reveals extraordinary new details of what happened.";Documentary;BBC TWO;Contains upsetting scenes.;2019;58;news, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p07jxnlf.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07jxnlf.jpg;telling story one deadliest day gaza strip generation made awardwinning documentary maker olly lambert one day gaza examines moment moment happened fateful day 14 may 2018 started day mass protest gaza ’ border israel would end one deadly day gaza generation week palestinian protesting along border fence tension running particularly high due opening new united state embassy israel jerusalem controversial step ordered donald trump ivanka trump jared kushner senior u official gathered jerusalem inaugurate new embassy ten thousand palestinian gathered site along gaza border barely 40 mile away sun set day 60 palestinian dead dying two thousand lay injured many live ammunition drawing 120 hour archive footage filmed side border day including exclusive video released hamas palestinian militant group dominates gaza israel defense force film reveals complex reality human toll day asks blame bloodshed also feature exclusive interview senior commander intelligence officer israel defense force well political leader hamas islamic jihad another militant group civilian present side border really happened day israel said troop opened fire selfdefence people using protest cover armed infiltration palestinian human right group accused israeli troop using excessive force unarmed civilian posed threat 60minute film reveals extraordinary new detail happened;1

Growing up in an ex-mining village in County Durham, Jamie has already faced his fair share of difficulties after coming out as gay at 14. However, with the majority of his family and friends being supportive, he has decided that he is ready to share his passion with the world.

He plans to embrace who he really is by attending his end of school prom in drag, but he doesn't get the reaction he'd hoped for from both his school and, heart-breakingly, his own father. So Jamie has to make some difficult decisions.

Jamie spends time with an established drag artist and battles his demons, performing as his alter ego, Fifi La True, for the very first time in front of a large audience.

As Jamie has some frank and intimate family moments, and finds out just how strong he really is, the film explores his hopes and fears for the future. Will he get the acceptance he craves from his peers and the confidence to be who he really is?

(1987);A countdown to an execution in Mississippi, revealing the effect on prison staff and other death-row inmates as time runs out for one young man. (1987);"There is one crime on the record of Edward Earl Johnson, a 26-year-old African-American man from Mississippi - murder. He was convicted on the sole evidence of signing a confession he had not written. Johnson always denied the killing and appealed against his death sentence for eight years in the US courts.

Fourteen Days in May is a countdown to an execution, revealing the effect on prison staff and other death-row inmates as time runs out for one young man. (1987)

This documentary is part of Louis Theroux: Docs That Made Me, a collection of Louis favourite documentaries.
Among documentary makers, Fourteen Days in May is heralded as a powerful and important piece of storytelling. Louis notes the way the story is told dispassionately until the moment when filmmakers 'break the fourth wall' and say goodbye to the condemned man, Edward Earl Johnson. Under normal circumstances, this tonal shift would be seen as an error of judgment but here it's an enormously emotional moment.

When a corpse impossibly vanishes from a locked study, it is only the first in a chain of dark mysteries confronting Jonathan Creek.;"When a dead body impossibly vanishes from a locked study, it is only the first in a chain of dark mysteries confronting Jonathan Creek and self-styled paranormal investigator Joey Ross.

Writer, producer, political campaigner and all round polymath Franklin Tartikoff is one of the country's most eminent intellectuals. But tragedy and horror are about to engulf the vast old country house he shares with his beautiful wife Rosalind, and their adopted daughter Fariba.

On the day that Fariba returns from a spiritual journey to the remote Far Eastern island where she was born, her mother is attending the funeral of an old school friend... an event that will unleash disturbing memories of a classmate whose macabre death, 50 years ago in the school dormitory, was never explained.

Today, Waxwood Hall convent school lies eerily empty and derelict. But as Rosalind Tartikoff revisits her childhood haunts she finds that ghosts from the past still stalk its gloomy interior. Now a lecturer in humanities and modern philosophy, and an avowed religious sceptic, how can she bear to admit - even to herself - that as a rebellious teenager in the Sixties she once had a miraculous vision of God?

And when her life is ripped apart by the shocking death of her husband, and a disappearing act that appears to defy the laws of science - the very fabric of everything she believes in - there is only one person she feels she can turn to... who, in a world of 'gods and spirits and magic and miracles can still fly the flag for common sense'.

A grisly murder, the macabre history of a Catholic girls' school, a sinister local society and a series of increasingly puzzling, interlocking clues form the backdrop to another weird and wonderful case for Creek and Joey - where this time they find themselves merely junior players, in an inquiry spearheaded by the flamboyant and indomitable detective inspector, Gideon Pryke.

Obama became president determined to rid the world of nuclear weapons. To begin the process he needed Russian help. So he set out to reset relations with Russia. Ignoring Putin, whom many considered still in charge, he concentrated on Medvedev.  
 
Top officials on both sides take viewers deep inside the negotiations. They describe how a phone call between the two young lawyer-presidents finally clinched the agreement - which cut their countries' nuclear arsenals in half. 
 
But inside Russia, Medvedev had a harder time. He responded to the 2008 global financial crisis by setting out to make Russia into a modern democratic economy. He made little progress. He told Obama that Russia's most famous dissident, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, would get a fair trial. It did not happen.  
 
In the end, Medvedev stepped aside and nominated Putin to be their party's presidential candidate for the 2012 election.

Dana International won for Israel singing ""Diva"" on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the state of Israel. She had been at the centre of much media attention in both her country and in the rest of Europe because she was the first openly transgender competitor in the contest. This year marked the last that a Eurovision orchestra was used and the last year with a language restriction. It was also the first year that mass televoting was used instead of the traditional juries.

It was FYR Macedonia's debut in the competition after failing to get their 1996 entry past the qualifier judges, while Belgium, Finland, Israel, Romania and Slovakia were all able to return to the competition after their year's exclusion for getting the lowest average scores. The voting was extremely close with Israel, Malta and the United Kingdom all vying for top spot as the final votes were cast. Eventually the UK came in second with Malta a very close third. 

The contest is also famous for a Eurovision faux-pas. On hearing that the Dutch announcer once performed in the contest, co-host Ulrika Johnson said: ""A long time ago was it?"" provoking laughs and boos from the audience. In fact her seemingly insulting comment was in reply to something Conny van den Bos had said about performing many years ago, although this was lost in the noise from the spectators.";Entertainment;BBC WEBONLY;False;1998;179;from-the-archives;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09gq37m.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09gq37m.jpg;43rd annual eurovision song contest broadcast national indoor arena birmingham terry wogan managed host commentate event alongside swedishborn multilingual presenter ulrika jonsson dana international israel singing diva 50th anniversary establishment state israel centre much medium attention country rest europe first openly transgender competitor contest year marked last eurovision orchestra used last year language restriction also first year mass televoting used instead traditional jury fyr macedonia debut competition failing get 1996 entry past qualifier judge belgium finland israel romania slovakia able return competition year exclusion getting lowest average score voting extremely close israel malta united kingdom vying top spot final vote cast eventually uk came second malta close third contest also famous eurovision fauxpas hearing dutch announcer performed contest cohost ulrika johnson said long time ago provoking laugh boo audience fact seemingly insulting comment reply something conny van den bos said performing many year ago although lost noise spectator;19

Four years later a German immigrant carpenter, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, was convicted of the murder of the baby and died in the electric chair.

The Lindbergh Kidnapping was at the time the ‘Trial of the Century’, a worldwide sensation that inspired many films and books over the years, including Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express. 

But doubts have existed from the beginning about the guilt of Hauptmann. In 1982, with new evidence, his 83-year-old widow reopened the case and sued the State of New Jersey for the wrongful execution of her husband, but her claim was dismissed. 

Ludovic Kennedy looks at the evidence only recently made public and shows that doubts are now more than ever justified.

Rolling up her sleeves to help with their planning and prep, she also hopes to learn what the dishes at the heart of these joyous meals mean to the people who love them and what they say about the city these families all call home. 

Andi’s three feasts of Christmas begin when she meets Sara Capaldi and her husband Antonio De Carla, a couple who are part of a big clan of Italian Glaswegians whose Christmas celebrations are built round the classic Italian recipes the family has always known and loved. The centrepiece of the meal is porchetta, traditionally prepared days ahead by curing it with salt, garlic, sage and rosemary. 

The second family to invite Andi to share their seasonal celebratory meal are the Chaudhrys. Hashim and his wife Atika live with his mum Farkhanda and his dad Masud. They’re Muslims of Pakistani heritage but true Glaswegians, or in Hash’s words 'GlaswegAsians', who love to celebrate along with the rest of the city at this time of year. A family feast at the Chaudhrys is a big affair which always sees Farkhanda and Atika preparing a range of salads, curries and meat dishes – two of which Andi gets stuck into to help get it on the table. Dishes include Farkhanda's shoe kebabs, named because the patties of minced chicken are shaped to resemble shoes. 

The third and final family to throw open their doors to Andi are the Youngs. Mum Eleanor and Dad Ron are from families that trace their history back to Glasgow as far as anyone can remember. They have three daughters - Amelia, Claudia and Olivia. Ron is in charge of the turkey, but the big event is all the veg that goes with it, with loads of different dishes to make sure everyone gets what they love most. For the girls, the Christmas meal can’t start without Eleanor’s mum Jean’s traditional cock-a-leekie soup.

The family’s first stop is a modern convenience store that is trialling a new app which could completely transform the role of the local shopkeeper. When the Ardern’s first opened their corner shop, life behind the counter was labour intensive. With no self-service and a shop full of loose goods, shopkeepers had to do almost everything for the customer. The arrival of self service in the 1960s changed all that. From then on, shopkeepers did less and less and the customer more and more. By the time the family closed up shop in 1997, all the shopkeeper had to do was stand behind a counter and take the money.  Dave and Sam find out how a new ‘pay-in-aisle’ app means shopkeepers don’t even have to man the till. As a 21-year-old, Sam loves the speed, convenience and, frankly, not having to chat. Dave is less sure and worries that losing the interaction between customer and shopkeeper is a step too far for smaller shops. Much cheaper to install than a self-service check-out, it could be the future for all our local shops. 

Next stop is Panda Store in Sheffield, opened to cater for one of the city’s newest and fastest growing communities - Chinese students.   During their 100 years in the shop, the Arderns discovered how corner shops constantly adapted to reflect – and profit from - the changing neighbourhood, from the 1890s, when the customers were mainly local women looking for everyday necessities, to the 1950s, when an influx of new shift workers from the Commonwealth brought early starts, late nights and plenty of white rum. By the 90s, Britain was more diverse than ever and corner shops were much faster than the supermarkets at catering for potential new customers. Nowadays, the most popular model for local shops is to try and cater for absolutely everyone, but Panda Stores is finding success by doing the opposite and going niche.    Jo and Sam visit to check out what the shop stocks to attract the 6,000 Chinese students who call Sheffield home and, of course, to try out some of the shop’s best-selling items. 

Getting customers through the door has always been a vital part of shop keeping and during their time running the shop, the Arderns came up with all kinds of novel and exciting ways to entice people in - from a fruit machine to cash in on Sheffield’s 1920s gambling epidemic and making the most of a national addiction to hula hooping in the 50s to installing a snooker table for a snooker-mad city in the 70s and installing lottery machines in 1994, just in time for Britain’s first ever national lottery draw. Sara invites the whole family to try out what could be the next big thing – a chocolate-head-making machine. Using 3D technology, it makes an exact replica of Dave’s head – but will anyone dare take a bite? It might seem high tech now but this could be perfect bit of kit for shopkeepers of the future to keep attracting customers through the door.  

With the supermarkets next door, local shops are having to find new ways to compete. The family discover the merits of offering plastic-free shopping and how some shops survive by being run by the community itself. But one local shop is fighting the supermarkets in a completely different way – by going back to the past. W Martyn in north London still has the original polished wood shelves and counter and offers loose goods and full customer service. Dave and Sam visit to discover how this approach has helped them stay open for 122 years.  

While many local shops are thriving, the traditional corner shop has all but disappeared. Sara and Polly meet the Arderns for one last time in an old corner shop that has found a new lease of life as a café. As a welcoming place for a friendly chat, it also offers free classes for kids and displays local art. All over the country, corner shops have been repurposed, their location making them perfect spots for cafes, coffees shops and microbreweries! The spirit of the corner shop still lives on in the building at the heart of its community.";Food;BBC TWO;False;2020;59;food, history, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p084lgjs.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p084lgjs.jpg;final episode series family reflect 100 year shop investigate shopkeeper today using lesson past technology future keep till ringing 21st century family ’ first stop modern convenience store trialling new app could completely transform role local shopkeeper ardern ’ first opened corner shop life behind counter labour intensive selfservice shop full loose good shopkeeper almost everything customer arrival self service 1960s changed shopkeeper le le customer time family closed shop 1997 shopkeeper stand behind counter take money dave sam find new ‘ payinaisle ’ app mean shopkeeper ’ even man till 21yearold sam love speed convenience frankly chat dave le sure worry losing interaction customer shopkeeper step far smaller shop much cheaper install selfservice checkout could future local shop next stop panda store sheffield opened cater one city ’ newest fastest growing community chinese student 100 year shop arderns discovered corner shop constantly adapted reflect – profit changing neighbourhood 1890s customer mainly local woman looking everyday necessity 1950s influx new shift worker commonwealth brought early start late night plenty white rum 90 britain diverse ever corner shop much faster supermarket catering potential new customer nowadays popular model local shop try cater absolutely everyone panda store finding success opposite going niche jo sam visit check shop stock attract 6000 chinese student call sheffield home course try shop ’ bestselling item getting customer door always vital part shop keeping time running shop arderns came kind novel exciting way entice people fruit machine cash sheffield ’ 1920s gambling epidemic making national addiction hula hooping 50 installing snooker table snookermad city 70 installing lottery machine 1994 time britain ’ first ever national lottery draw sara invite whole family try could next big thing – chocolateheadmaking machine using 3d technology make exact replica dave ’ head – anyone dare take bite might seem high tech could perfect bit kit shopkeeper future keep attracting customer door supermarket next door local shop find new way compete family discover merit offering plasticfree shopping shop survive run community one local shop fighting supermarket completely different way – going back past w martyn north london still original polished wood shelf counter offer loose good full customer service dave sam visit discover approach helped stay open 122 year many local shop thriving traditional corner shop disappeared sara polly meet arderns one last time old corner shop found new lease life café welcoming place friendly chat also offer free class kid display local art country corner shop repurposed location making perfect spot cafe coffee shop microbrewery spirit corner shop still life building heart community;13

An ordinary house in south London is their time machine, transporting them through five decades and two world wars. Guided by presenters Giles Coren and social historian Polly Russell, they trace the incredible changes to Britain's diet and the extraordinary social transformation they reveal.

In episode four, the family discover a very surprising decade of progress and optimism as they journey through the 1930s. Gone is all the starch formality of previous decades. Their larder is now stuffed with familiar brands and snacks and deliciously healthy dinners too, even if they are made in a pressure cooker that looks more like an unexploded bomb than a bit of kitchen equipment.

Along the way, Brandon and Rochelle take a trip out for dinner and a dance in their very first family car and there is popcorn to go with their own home cinema, but the family's old servant Debbie finds out that the 30s bring hard times for working women like her.

Sam Evans and Shauna Guinn meet up with the amazing team at Surfability at Caswell Bay, whose volunteers aim to make sure that surfing is something everyone can do. Specially adapted boards mean that having a disability is no barrier to enjoying the waves.

That is definitely something to celebrate, so with the help of the volunteers and some surfing dudes and dudettes, Sam and Shauna cook up an amazing feast.

Firstly, they teach them how to make a simple and tasty vegetarian dish of grilled hispi cabbage with garlic, lemon buttermilk dressing and a Lebanese fattoush salad.

Then it is a quick trip down to the Gower Salt Marsh to learn about the unique environment the sheep there live in, which makes the lamb highly sought after. For the next dish, they make kofta flatbreads and barbecue lamb ribs with a maple ketchup.

Of course, no visit to Caswell Bay is complete without a spot of surfing, so Sam and Shauna take to the waves where they make a big splash!

in London, Paris and Washington, the abolitionist movement was gathering momentum. After the slave rebellion in Santo Domingo, and facing the public opinion’s growing outrage, the major European powers abolished the trans-Atlantic trade in 1807. 

Yet Europe, in the midst of the industrial revolution, could not do without the slave workforce. To satisfy its needs in raw materials, it pushed further the frontiers of slavery and turned a blind eye on the new forms of human exploitation in Brazil, the United States and Africa. At a time when legal trade was finally prohibited, the deportation of African captives would explode, and become more important than ever. Within 50 years, nearly 2.5 million were deported.

Bho 1789 gu 1888: Crìochan Ùra Tràilleachd. Ann an Lunnainn, Paris is Washington, bha an iomairt an aghaidh tràilleachd a' sìor-fhàs. Às dèidh rèabhlaid nan tràill ann an Santo Domingo, is seach gu robh am poball a' tionndadh na aghaidh, chuir rìoghachdan mòra na h-Eòrpa stad air malairt nan tràill tarsainn a' Chuain Shiar ann an 1807. Ach, ann san tionndadh gnìomhachais, cha dèanadh an Roinn Eòrpa a' chùis às aonais tràillean. Bha feum air bun-stuthan is chaidh tràilleachd a phutadh chun iomaill, is cha robh guth air an droch-dhìoladh ann am Braisil, na Stàitean Aonaichte is Afraga. Aig àm nuair a chaidh malairt laghail a chasg mu dheireadh thall, dheidheadh an àireamh de dh'Afraganaich a chaidh an toirt am bruid am meud gu mòr, is dh'fhàsadh e na bu cudromaiche na bha e riamh.

Aided by a team of experts, Lucy recreates the most important elements of the ceremony and the celebrations, scouring history books, archives, newspapers and Queen Victoria's diaries for the details. She reveals how every moment was brilliantly stage-managed for maximum effect. Like every good marriage celebration, the film is a heady mix of fine food, fabulous clothes, music, emotion, gossip and intrigue.

Presented by Alex Jones.;"In this final episode, original factory girls give first-hand accounts of their experiences on the factory floor, at the kitchen sink and on raucous nights out. The women speak of terrifying bosses, everyday sexism, union battles, camaraderie and of lifelong friendships forged on the production line. With Wales-born presenter Alex Jones guiding us through this most important chapter in industrial history, the programme also shows how the factory was lovingly brought back to life using the testimony of those original factory girls as inspiration.

The women's real-life stories are grounded in the south Wales valleys where female factory workers were poorly paid, unfairly treated and denied basic rights. In the 60s and early 70s it was perfectly legal for women to be paid less than men, to be sacked when they were pregnant and to be denied the right to apply for the same jobs as men. But women fought back, and when the female workers at Ford Dagenham walked out demanding equal pay, they set in motion a fight for equal pay in factories across Britain.

The original factory girls share their memories of starting work at the factories, often swapping the school gates for the factory floor at the age of 15. A job in the factory gave the teenagers the freedom and wages they had never had. But as they grew in experience and became skilled seamstresses they realised they were being treated as second-class citizens, often working in harsh conditions and earning much less than their male counterparts. There was little equality at home too - once the shift was over, it would be time to go home to make the tea. But there was also a lot of fun to be had in the factory. The long hours, sitting side by side on the production line, gave the women a strong sense of camaraderie and they forged friendships that would last a lifetime.

But then came the 80s - while conditions had improved and the fight for equality was starting to pay off, the clothing industry came under serious threat with the loss government subsidies and the economic pressures of globalisation. The original factory girls share their devastation at seeing their livelihood and whole way of life come to an end.

He was sent to Dachau, Dora, Harzungen, Bergen-Belsen and Natzweiler – one of the Nazis' least known but most deadly camps. Twenty years after the war, Pahor wrote an extraordinary book about his experiences called Necropolis - City of the Dead.

Alan Yentob visits Boris Pahor at his home in Trieste, where he talks about his fight against fascism and the Nazis. Boris, a Slovenian, was born in the tolerant, cosmopolitan city of Trieste in 1913. After World War I, when it became part of Italy and Mussolini rose to power, fascists burned down the Slovene cultural centre, closed their schools and the speaking of Slovene in public was banned. During World War II, Boris fought with the Italian army until its surrender in 1943, when he returned to Trieste just before the Nazis took over the city. He joined the Slovene resistance but was betrayed and handed over to the Gestapo, and sent on to the camps. Natzweiler, where he was to stay the longest, is hidden in the mountains of Alsace. Nearly half of its 52,000 prisoners died through the effects of forced labour, malnutrition, illness and execution. The Nazis conducted medical experiments on prisoners and, on one occasion, 86 Jews were brought to the camp and executed to provide skeletons for a Nazi professor of anatomy’s collection. Natzweiler was the first concentration camp in western Europe to be discovered by the Allies – but the camp was empty, its prisoners has been taken to Dachau.

Pahor’s harrowing descriptions are illustrated with remarkable drawings by fellow prisoners, creating a unique record of conditions in the Nazi death camps. His testimony, along with details from a shocking report into the camp by British intelligence officer Captain Yurka Galitzine and the chilling testimony by SS commandant Josef Kramer, infamous as the Beast of Belsen, combine to tell an extraordinary story.

She shows how the years 1825-1918 were bloody and traumatic, a period when four tsars tried - and failed - to deal with the growing pressure for constitutional reform and revolution.

Lucy finds out how the Romanovs tried to change the system themselves - in 1861, millions of enslaved serfs were freed by the Tsar-Liberator, Alexander II. But Alexander paid the ultimate penalty for opening the Pandora's box of reform when he was later blown up by terrorists on the streets of St Petersburg. 

Elsewhere, there was repression, denial, war and - in the case of the last tsar, Nicholas II - a fatalistic belief in the power of God, with Nicholas's faith in the notorious holy man Rasputin being a major part in his undoing. Lucy also details the chilling murder of Nicholas and his family in 1918, and asks whether all of this horror have been avoided.

Lucy also shows how there was a growing movement among the people of Russia to determine their own fate. She traces the growth of the intelligentsia, writers and thinkers who sought to have a voice about Russia. Speaking out came with a risk - after Ivan Turgenev wrote about the appalling life of the serfs in 1852, he was sentenced to house arrest by tsar Nicholas I. Lucy also shows how anger against the Romanov regime created a later generation of radicals committed to overturning the status quo. Some would turn to terrorism and, finally, revolution.

As well as political upheaval there is private drama, and Lucy explains how Nicholas II's family life played into his family's downfall. His son and heir Alexei suffered from haemophilia - the secrecy the family placed around the condition led them into seclusion, further distancing them from the Russian people.

The Price of Freedom;David Olusoga traces the propaganda war waged between pro-slavery lobby and abolitionists.;Documentary. David Olusoga traces the bitter propaganda war waged between the pro-slavery lobby and the abolitionists.;"Historian David Olusoga continues his examination of Britain's forgotten slave owners. In this episode, David explores how in 1834 the government arrived at the extraordinary decision to compensate the slave owners with the equivalent of £17 billion in today's money. Tracing the bitter propaganda war waged between the pro-slavery lobby and the abolitionists, he reveals that paying off the slave owners for the loss of their human property was, ultimately, the only way to bring the system to an end.

Meticulously kept records held at the National Archives detail the names of the 46,000 slave owners from across the British empire who had a slice of this vast handout. Combined with new research, shared exclusively with the BBC by University College London, it reveals more about Britain's slave owners than we've ever known before.

Of the 46,000 names in the 1834 compensation records, 3,000 lived in Britain, yet they owned half of the slaves across the empire and pocketed half of the compensation money. These include members of the clergy and of the House of Lords. The records also show that at the point of abolition, more than 40 per cent of all the slave owners were women.

David goes on to investigate what happened to the wealth generated by the slave system and compensation pay out. He reveals aspects of Britain's spectacular industrialisation in the 19th century, the consolidation of the City of London as a world centre of finance, and a number of the country's most well-known institutions that all have links to slave-derived wealth.

Ultimately, David discovers that the country's debt to slavery is far greater than previously thought, shaping everything from the nation's property landscape to its ideas about race. A legacy that can still be felt today.";History;BBC TWO;False;2015;59;history, documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p08gkbzx.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p08gkbzx.jpg;historian david olusoga continues examination britain forgotten slave owner episode david explores 1834 government arrived extraordinary decision compensate slave owner equivalent £17 billion today money tracing bitter propaganda war waged proslavery lobby abolitionist reveals paying slave owner loss human property ultimately way bring system end meticulously kept record held national archive detail name 46000 slave owner across british empire slice vast handout combined new research shared exclusively bbc university college london reveals britain slave owner weve ever known 46000 name 1834 compensation record 3000 lived britain yet owned half slave across empire pocketed half compensation money include member clergy house lord record also show point abolition 40 per cent slave owner woman david go investigate happened wealth generated slave system compensation pay reveals aspect britain spectacular industrialisation 19th century consolidation city london world centre finance number country wellknown institution link slavederived wealth ultimately david discovers country debt slavery far greater previously thought shaping everything nation property landscape idea race legacy still felt today;1

From there, he built up a business empire of a corner shop, a chip shop and a hotel. Onkar also unearths why a fifth of corner shops in Wales are run by Indian immigrants. In the valleys and tight-knit communities outside big cities, Asian immigration helped smooth race relations, but in urban areas it was a different story.

In June 1856, the 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, left his home in Bangor to travel across Scotland and on to the Arctic in a small sailing schooner. After travelling 6,000 miles in four months, Lord Dufferin published a best-selling account of his journey and in the process set the course for the rest of his life. He became the most outstanding diplomat of the Victorian era, a charming fixer solving international and domestic disputes everywhere from Canada to Burma.

Leon McCarron recreates this seminal voyage by following the accounts written in Lord Dufferin's book, introducing us to some of the stories of this extraordinary man.

But will all their practise pay off to win them a medal?;"Bailey and Summer are budding ballroom champions from Blackwood, South Wales. Bailey has autism and is also visually impaired, but if anything, autism is the secret to Bailey’s success. It gives him focus and determination, and he has never been self-conscious on the dance floor. After 18 months of lockdowns and dancing on their own - in their kitchens and bedrooms - Summer and Bailey are now finally back in training for the biggest competition of their lives, at the world-famous Tower Ballroom in Blackpool.

Summer and Bailey are firm friends. We meet them as they celebrate turning 13 together over a meal with their families, the all-important members of the Bailey and Summer dance support team. Dancing ballroom at competition level is a huge commitment for everyone, especially parents, who get to spend their evenings taxiing the dancers to their lessons, and are also required to buy some very expensive dance outfits. As for the dancers themselves, ballroom success means hours and hours of hard work on the dance floor.

Bailey and Summer go to their busy local dance school most nights of the week for three or four-hour training sessions. When he is not doing ballroom and Latin with Summer, Bailey is out doing ballet classes, as well as tap and jazz. Summer’s school friends are all into dance, and on an afternoon in the park they choreograph their own routine and talk frankly about how dancing has kept them going during lockdown.

Bailey’s autism can give him anxiety, so he likes to know exactly what he is doing and needs to keep to a regular weekly schedule. He feels that dance is the thing that helps him free his mind and keep him calm in times of stress.

As part of their preparations for Blackpool, Summer and Bailey take part in an online dance competition where they survive an unlucky incident with a flying shoe! As the big competition approaches, they are lucky enough to be invited backstage at the studios of their favourite TV show, Strictly Come Dancing, where they are given competition tips from some of the Strictly stars.

As the Blackpool Championships get closer, we see Bailey and Summer’s final preparations: the competition haircuts, the tricky business of choosing the right costume, and of course the all-important competition spray tan! Summer and Bailey dance ballroom and Latin, but of all the different steps their favourite is the cha-cha-cha. Is this the routine that will win them a medal?

At Blackpool there are more than 600 competitors in the different classes and categories, and it is a heady atmosphere on the dance floor as dancers from all over the UK celebrate their first chance to dance in public since Covid shut everything down.

In this episode, expensive films and cheap flights mean Scotland is swarming with excited tourists.;"In the autumn of 1995, two events transformed Scottish tourism - Braveheart was released and the first ever Easyjet flight took off, from Luton to Glasgow.

Braveheart sold Scotland around the world, making it synonymous with Mel Gibson’s epic. Meanwhile, low-budget airlines and the deregulation of air travel enabled direct routes from the US to open up. The year following Braveheart's release saw the first Tartan Day parade in New York, and Sean Connery beseeched long-lost Scots to return to their homeland. 

However, the tourism business itself was changing rapidly, with the emerging internet giving tourists a chance to be a travel critic themselves via TripAdvisor reviews, travel blogs and the like, and Scotland had to play catch up to ensure even the smallest businesses had a website. In 2006, the tourist board renamed itself Visit Scotland, and its focus has increasingly been online marketing – including paying influencers and Instagrammers to come and promote Scotland.

The second most popular subject searched for online is genealogy, and Scotland has benefited from a glut of Americans, Australians and South Africans returning to trace their roots. Roots tourism is a huge market, and when people track down their ancestors to a cottage or grave, it often cements a deep and meaningful bond with Scotland and with their ancestors' place in Scottish history.

Visitors come in search of ‘the real Scotland’ - the rustic fisherman’s cottage, the folk music in the pub, the empty glen. However, due to the money to be made, everyday life in Scotland is often changed by tourism. Edinburgh has suffered from relentless waves of tourism, and a walk down the Royal Mile shows the capital is in danger of turning into a tartan theme park. But Edinburghers are fighting back, questioning the need for more hotels and fighting for residents' rights.

In rural Scotland, the benefits of tourism are also bittersweet, with campaigns to curtail Airbnb and a plea to ensure local communities are not overwhelmed by coach tours and tourism.";Documentary;BBC SCOTLAND;False;2021;58;documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09czd1p.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09czd1p.jpg;autumn 1995 two event transformed scottish tourism braveheart released first ever easyjet flight took luton glasgow braveheart sold scotland around world making synonymous mel gibson ’ epic meanwhile lowbudget airline deregulation air travel enabled direct route u open year following bravehearts release saw first tartan day parade new york sean connery beseeched longlost scot return homeland however tourism business changing rapidly emerging internet giving tourist chance travel critic via tripadvisor review travel blog like scotland play catch ensure even smallest business website 2006 tourist board renamed visit scotland focus increasingly online marketing – including paying influencers instagrammers come promote scotland second popular subject searched online genealogy scotland benefited glut american australian south african returning trace root root tourism huge market people track ancestor cottage grave often cement deep meaningful bond scotland ancestor place scottish history visitor come search ‘ real scotland ’ rustic fisherman ’ cottage folk music pub empty glen however due money made everyday life scotland often changed tourism edinburgh suffered relentless wave tourism walk royal mile show capital danger turning tartan theme park edinburghers fighting back questioning need hotel fighting resident right rural scotland benefit tourism also bittersweet campaign curtail airbnb plea ensure local community overwhelmed coach tour tourism;3

His father, Michael, has missed an appointment with his mental health worker, and no-one knows where he is. Michael is known to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and is thought to have stopped taking his medication. When PC Jade Chitcuti leads a search of Michael’s house in Cheltenham, the evidence of his paranoia is clear for police to see. While Michael is not thought to be suicidal, he is known to hide, which could place him at increased risk if he is outdoors and not found quickly.

Michael has been receiving treatment for his mental health for many years and this is not the first time he has gone missing.  Oli is becoming increasingly desperate to find a way of helping Michael and restoring him to the happy, cheerful father he remembers.  But try as he might, Oli is battling to get his father to acknowledge he is ill and to get him to accept the treatment he needs. When police find Michael hiding after three days out in the open, having had nothing to eat or drink, it’s an indication of how much he will neglect himself in his bid to get away.

Can their mates make it through the day without food or water?;"As Muslims, rapper Krept and vlogger Rumena both look forward to the holy month of Ramadan as a time for reflection and self-improvement, but this year will be a little different.

In the year of the pandemic panic, there will be no mosques with fellow worshippers, no late-night shisha with friends and no full-on feasts with the family. Which means young Muslims across the world are hungry for camaraderie and banter after weeks of isolation. Enter social media apps and video calls to keep the joy and community spirit of the holy month alive.

So as the boredom for all of us has fully set in - where virtual pub quizzes have become passé, boxsets have been binged and your hour of government-mandated exercise is no longer cutting it - Krept and Rumena get their non-Muslim mates in on the Ramadan act. They challenge their mates Kritikal and Olivia to join them in a day of no eating and drinking to learn about the true experience of Ramadan. Fasting in lockdown might be a match made in heaven!

Watch the outrageous 3.00am wake-up calls demanding that they drag themselves out of bed and get some food down them. Brace for the 11.00am sugar crash and desperate pleas for a sip of water. Witness the 5.00pm delirium as the lack of calories sets in and the temptation to cheat on a cheeky snack kicks in. Finally, friends get together on video chat to count down the moments before breaking their fast and capture that true friendship of achieving something together.

Will the carb crash be ugly or enlightening? Can you calm your hyperactive friend by banning their morning coffee? Will the confident chest thumpers fail at fasting before they have even got to lunchtime? Can you really trust your mates not to cheat on the challenge? And will the experience help friends learn more about each others’ communities?

Can they make us addicted? Are they a conduit to violent behaviour? Are these even the right questions to ask? 
With a pandemic in full swing, and more people than ever spending their lives online, we believe there is a better question to be asked: How do video games make us feel? 
While some still warn of their risks, some argue video games can, and have been, helpful for people’s wellbeing.
We meet Abi, from Weston-Super-Mare, a gamer and cosplayer whose love for a particular game, ‘The Last of Us’, helped her become more in-tune with her own emotions, feelings and identity.
Joe, an old school gamer from Glasgow, told us about how gaming helped him in coming to terms with his depression; and Elissa, from London, details how ‘Animal Crossing’ made the lockdown much easier for her and her friends at uni, providing the connection and sense of community they were missing.

Because of the way land ownership has historically been recorded in Scotland, it can be even harder to find out who owns our rural land than it is to find out who owns the land in our town and cities. With the help of researcher and writer Andy Wightman, and the visualisation skills of design collective Lateral North, Martin explores what we do and don’t know about land ownership in rural Scotland and finds out why it matters.

Martin visits Lossiemouth, where ownerless property is losing the town a fortune in tourist income, and finds out how patchy and incomplete historic records saw the anglers of Selkirk miss out on their traditional fishing rights. He sees how easy it has been in the past for landowners to hide behind offshore trusts and explores an ancient pine forest and a highland estate to ask whether the way we think about and value our rural land is changing.

After a public vote, Betty Campbell was chosen from a shortlist of incredible women from history to be immortalised as the first public statue of a named Welsh woman. Those who knew Betty well recall the life and work of this community icon from Cardiff’s Butetown and her journey from a tough childhood marked by tragedy and setbacks to the pioneering achievements that brought her plaudits from the likes of Nelson Mandela.

Told a working-class black girl could never achieve her ambitions, Betty proved her doubters wrong by battling racism to pursue her goal. After becoming Wales’s first black head teacher in 1973 on her home patch of Butetown, she made history, and ensured her pupils knew their history, by putting their multicultural heritage on the school curriculum. Her pioneering approach saw her create her own books and projects to teach her pupils about the positive contribution to British society by people of all races. She also helped create Black History Month.

Former pupils tell of how Betty Campbell's support was vital to their success. One, Louise Kelton, left Cardiff in her early twenties and rose to one of the highest positions in American law enforcement after being nominated by President Barack Obama to become a US marshall. Cerys discovers how Betty’s influence on Wales grew beyond the classroom with positions in public life and politics, and she finds out how Betty proved a passionate advocate for the people of Butetown as a councillor.

Filmed over three years, the programme follows the unfolding story of the groundbreaking statue that will keep her legacy alive, including the challenge faced by the world-renowned sculptor chosen to capture this heroine’s spirit.

The phenomenon known as ‘multi-level marketing’ is sweeping across social media as 'influencers' post job adverts offering the chance of six-figure incomes, cars and holidays in return for selling products online. More than 400,000 people in the UK are already signed up and the industry has thousands of passionate supporters. 
 
But as Ellie digs deeper into two companies, she uncovers a darker side behind these enticing Instagram posts and investigates accusations of illegal pyramid selling, systematic targeting of vulnerable people by recruiters and even brainwashing.  
 
Travelling the length of the country, Ellie meets former sellers like young mum Vickie, who made only £20 after spending six months following the training at cosmetics company Nu Skin in the hope she could make enough money for her maternity leave. Ellie also meets Lindsay, who has a chronic illness and hoped selling for makeup company Younique would help her cover the bills while she struggled to find full-time work. Three years later, Lindsay is now £3,000 in debt.
 
In search of answers and accountability from these billion-dollar companies, Ellie’s investigation takes her to Utah, USA, where many of these companies are based. 

This film raises concerns about an industry which seems to remain largely overlooked by regulators and mainstream media.

Reporter Ben Zand gains access to the most high-profile activist group, Extinction Rebellion.;"2019 has marked a change in public attitudes to climate change driven in part by a huge new global protest movement.

In this timely and powerful documentary, reporter Ben Zand gains access to the most important of the protest groups, Extinction Rebellion. He is with them for four months as they build towards “the rebellion” - 11 days of protest in April during which they take over and occupy four iconic locations in London.  

The film follows three young people who have been inspired to join and lead the protests. Many are not only protesting for the first time in their lives but are also putting their liberty on the line to demand radical action from the government. We are there as they organise street protests and direct actions - risking arrest for their commitment to the cause. 

16-year-old Dani from south London has never been on a protest before - since joining Extinction Rebellion in 2018, she has co-organised nationwide school strikes. Sam is 22 and a recent graduate, but now works full-time for Extinction Rebellion and is willing to get arrested again and again until something changes. Jack joined the movement recently at age 18. He is inspired by the tactics and research laid out by Extinction Rebellion and has an eye on organising controversial splinter actions for the movement. 

Ben also spends time with the leader of the movement, Roger Hallam, who has spent years academically researching tactics for social change. He says you need 2000 people to get arrested and 400 people to go to prison if you want the government to meet your demands. Ben challenges him on his methods and asks whether it is justifiable to encourage young people to break the law.

";"On 11 September 2001, 19 al-Qaeda hijackers snatched control of four passenger jets and committed an act of terrorism, the like of which had never been seen before. As television images of the burning twin towers in New York spread around the globe, normal life ended for many people as a series of events unfolded that would change the world forever.

Using first-hand testimony, this documentary pieces together the seismic consequences that have been keenly felt in Scotland over the last 20 years, from the moment when the first plane impacted in New York, to the present day.

Among those in Scotland whose lives were immediately affected were those in the Asian communities. As early reports suggested that those behind the attack were ‘Islamic’ and ‘extremist’, acts of racism became more common, more violent, and religious in nature. Muslims were suddenly faced with a very real and frightening backlash as they came under suspicion, were physically attacked, and their mosques were fire-bombed.

Yasmine Chaudhry was attacked on a bus only two days after 9/11, with her attacker smashing a glass bottle over her head after making it clear that he was doing it because of the attack.

Amjid Bashir was verbally attacked at McDonalds the next day. He had just attended Scotland’s biggest vigil for the victims when another customer suggested that a bullet should be added to his burger so his head ‘would be blown off’.

The reaction was swift and unsurprising, and within a month, the US and UK led an invasion of Afghanistan to dismantle al-Qaeda, hunt down its leader, Osama Bin Laden, and remove the Taliban from power. The war in Iraq, just over a year later, was not so easily justified and huge protests sprung up against it. Campaigner Osama Bhutta was one of those who spoke at the Stop the War march outside Glasgow’s SECC while Tony Blair was giving a speech inside. He felt crushed when the coalition, again led by the US and UK, went ahead and Scottish troops found themselves embroiled in two wars thousands of miles from home.
  
Rose Gentle lost her 19-year-old son, Gordon, when he was killed while on a routine patrol in Basra. After his death, she became a strong opponent of the war in Iraq. The inquest into his death concluded that it was through the failure of the UK government to provide adequate equipment, that her son died. 
 
Dave Devenney, a veteran Royal Marines Commando from the Falklands War in 1982, experienced both wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Scottish journalist David Pratt also saw both wars first hand. As foreign affairs editor for the Herald, he had reported from Afghanistan extensively from the days of the Russian occupation to the rise of the Taliban and had met Osama Bin Laden while there.
 
Despite the war in Afghanistan, terror campaigns continued, throughout the US and Europe. In 2005, the 7/7 bombings wreaked bloody havoc on London’s transport network, and two years later in Scotland, the people inside Glasgow Airport narrowly avoided a similar fate when it was attacked by two men in a burning jeep laden with explosive gas.

During this period the Muslim population of Scotland continued to feel the pressure of racist, violent and verbal attacks. Paramedic Araf Saddiq was verbally abused by patients who said they didn’t want to be treated by him as they thought he might be a terrorist. 
 
It is thought that up to a million people may have died in the US War on Terror and the campaign, which is now the longest in US history, is only now coming to a chaotic end in Afghanistan, after almost 20 years. Yet despite these many traumas, and attacks that have continued since then, some feel that Scotland’s experience of terrorism and its aftermath has not brought about the severe splits and division that might have been expected.";Documentary;BBC SCOTLAND;Contains very strong language.;2021;58;documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09vm0zr.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09vm0zr.jpg;11 september 2001 19 alqaeda hijacker snatched control four passenger jet committed act terrorism like never seen television image burning twin tower new york spread around globe normal life ended many people series event unfolded would change world forever using firsthand testimony documentary piece together seismic consequence keenly felt scotland last 20 year moment first plane impacted new york present day among scotland whose life immediately affected asian community early report suggested behind attack ‘ islamic ’ ‘ extremist ’ act racism became common violent religious nature muslim suddenly faced real frightening backlash came suspicion physically attacked mosque firebombed yasmine chaudhry attacked bus two day 911 attacker smashing glass bottle head making clear attack amjid bashir verbally attacked mcdonalds next day attended scotland ’ biggest vigil victim another customer suggested bullet added burger head ‘ would blown ’ reaction swift unsurprising within month u uk led invasion afghanistan dismantle alqaeda hunt leader osama bin laden remove taliban power war iraq year later easily justified huge protest sprung campaigner osama bhutta one spoke stop war march outside glasgow ’ secc tony blair giving speech inside felt crushed coalition led u uk went ahead scottish troop found embroiled two war thousand mile home rose gentle lost 19yearold son gordon killed routine patrol basra death became strong opponent war iraq inquest death concluded failure uk government provide adequate equipment son died dave devenney veteran royal marine commando falklands war 1982 experienced war afghanistan iraq scottish journalist david pratt also saw war first hand foreign affair editor herald reported afghanistan extensively day russian occupation rise taliban met osama bin laden despite war afghanistan terror campaign continued throughout u europe 2005 77 bombing wreaked bloody havoc london ’ transport network two year later scotland people inside glasgow airport narrowly avoided similar fate attacked two men burning jeep laden explosive gas period muslim population scotland continued feel pressure racist violent verbal attack paramedic araf saddiq verbally abused patient said ’ want treated thought might terrorist thought million people may died u war terror campaign longest u history coming chaotic end afghanistan almost 20 year yet despite many trauma attack continued since feel scotland ’ experience terrorism aftermath brought severe split division might expected;11

Did politics get in its way?;BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh examines the extraordinary ambition behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab. Intended as a vaccine for the world, did politics get in its way?;"Celebrated as our national jab, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been praised as a 'remarkable example of British innovation and scientific excellence' and recognised for its success at home. Around half of all adults in the UK received two doses of it.

But when Oxford scientists developed the jab, they had far greater ambitions: a 'vaccine for the world', designed specifically to be distributed to lower income countries and sold at cost for the duration of the pandemic. For both humanitarian and scientific reasons, they argued sharing vaccines fairly globally was the best way to bring coronavirus under control.

A year later, more than 2.5 billion doses have been distributed worldwide. But with only one in 20 people in low income countries double jabbed and the Omicron variant spreading globally, how far did the vaccine meet its original purpose?

Beset by challenges including supply disputes in Europe and, concerns over rare blood clots, the vaccine has never been approved in the US and is now barely used in the UK. So how much were these problems self-inflicted, or did nationalist politics get in the way?

Omar Benguit was jailed for killing 26-year-old Korean student Jong-Ok Shin as she walked home from a night out in Bournemouth in 2002. The only evidence to place him at the murder scene came from a heroin addict with a history of making false allegations against innocent people. Police used other vulnerable witnesses to support the addict’s story, but some of them tell Bronagh they were pressured to make false statements. She also finds evidence that could give Omar Benguit an alibi for the night of the murder.

Ellie Flynn travels to the USA to visit states poised to reconsider their child marriage laws. South Carolina is considering closing its 'marry-your-rapist' loophole that allows girls under 16 to marry if they are pregnant and have a parent’s consent. Visiting the record office in Spartanburg County, Ellie finds 16 child marriages in the county in the last decade. In ten of those cases, the groom could have been prosecuted under statutory rape laws.
 
One of these marriages was between teenager Keri, then 15, and Paul, then 24. When Keri became pregnant, Paul agreed to marry her and help look after the baby in order to avoid prison. This raises a central question for Ellie: whose rights are more important: the underage, pregnant girl or the unborn, potentially fatherless baby?
 
Ellie also travels to Georgia to meet 17-year-old Zion. She married at 16, and her groom David was just two years older than her, so Zion didn’t need to use the marry-your-rapist loophole, and nor was her groom at risk of prosecution for statutory rape. Many campaigners want to change Georgia’s minimum marriage age to 18, but Zion is convinced that this would have meant the end of her and David’s family, as they would have been forced to live apart for two years.
 
But not all child marriages end in family harmony. Often it breaks families apart, as Ellie finds out in Idaho. Here, a case involving conflicting laws, religious beliefs and ideas of parental responsibility left two men in prison and a family at war. In Idaho, child marriage laws require a court order from a judge, but in the state of Missouri only the consent of one parent is needed.

The police have publically said that they are struggling to tackle the increase in online child sex predators. The hunters say they are trying to help tackle the threat. While some of the evidence the hunters gather is used in some cases to charge suspects, the police are concerned about people being wrongly targeted and hurt. As well as some groups naming and shaming people online before police can assess any evidence.

Livvy speaks to founders and members of the hunter groups, their decoys used to catch suspected paedophiles online, the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the North West, and relatives of those wrongly accused.

An army of Siberian models is invading the west. Siberia is known around the world for its frigid temperatures, but within the fashion world it is famous for being home to the world's most beautiful women.

He meets Anya, who would love to be an artist but realistically knows that, here in Siberia, there's more chance of her making money as a model, Vika, who has been eating buckwheat for breakfast, lunch and dinner in a bid to lose those extra two centimetres for the casting, and Katia, whose parents are distraught when they have to make a decision about whether she goes to work in China - at the age of just 15.

Waldemar looks in considerable depth at the work of Georges Seurat, taking into consideration his academic training at the Beaux-Arts School in Paris and the artists that influenced him, such as Piero della Francesca and Puvis de Chavannes. 

There is also an insight into the complex but fascinating world of optics and art, and the ways in which the Impressionists were using the new discoveries in light and eyesight to influence their work. A fascinating 'after-image' experiment brings to life the ways in which our own eyes see colour, both in its presence and its absence.

Van Gogh's time in Paris, a period very little is known about, is also covered, charting the incredible journey the artist made from his brown and dull canvases to the splendid colour and light that pervaded his work on the cusp of his departure for the South of France. 

The film finishes with a revisiting of Monet and his later waterlily paintings in the Orangerie in Paris. Waldemar investigates how a bad case of cataracts was responsible for a seismic shift in his colour palette and his brushstrokes.

Hustle;Amira is determined to make it in the music industry and not be distracted by the violence;Amira is determined to make it in the music industry and transform her life with a big payday. She doesn’t want to be distracted by the violence around her.;"Last year, as London’s murder rate and youth violence hit the headlines, some parts of the capital were thrust into the spotlight. One of these areas was a corner of north London around Tottenham and Wood Green, where last spring three young people were murdered in consecutive months. But what about the young people who don’t make the news? This timely two-part series goes beyond the headlines to find out what life is really like growing up in an area that is as famous for its music industry icons as it is for the London riots or Premier League football.

21-year-old Amira is determined to follow in her brother’s footsteps by making it in the music industry. She’s trying to make it as an artist manager at a Tottenham-based record label. She’s focussed on launching Foz, a new artist fresh from Australia, and is determined not to be distracted by the troubles around her. She’s been to three funerals of friends within one year, all of whom have died as a result of youth violence. She thinks the area is one that can make or break
you, but she won’t let it break her. But with her MOBO-award winning brother away from the music scene for now, and unexpected challenges in her life, she’s also having to hold things together at home for her mum. Life is never straightforward, but Amira is always hustling to make it and earn that big payday.

On the streets nearby, we also meet Tash, who is living in the shadow of the new Spurs stadium. He’s put down his uni books to lead his neighbours in a fight against the council over housing. Tash’s family, like others on his estate, might lose their home if the planned redevelopment around the stadium goes ahead.

Up the road is business school student and entrepreneur Naomi. She’s a self-made model, working for the likes of Nike and Vivienne Westwood – and also a stylist to the stars. She’s fiercely defensive of the place that’s made her. She knows the value of Tottenham and uses her neighbourhood as inspiration for her work.

But that’s what made his death so confusing: the man everyone loved and looked up to was shot at least ten times on the very property he owned. 

Immediately, rumours started flowing. Who wanted Nipsey dead? Was it the police because of the message he was spreading? The government? Or an old gang dispute that had caught up with him?

Jim makes just 12 such chairs each year, using traditional techniques and aided by few modern tools. There are just two screws in the finished chair.

They grapple with tough, unsettling and emotional questions about being black and British in search of a way forward. Each of them has a deeply personal story to share about an event that proved to be a seismic moment in their life. They confront their differences, hoping to find answers from each other and from those who are trying to change Britain.

The most radical of the group, university professor Kehinde, set up Britain's first black studies degree. He believes it's time for a fundamental change to Britain. He has a revolutionary idea to reveal to the group which could prove divisive - black-only workplaces. Although recent years have seen black leaders taking the top jobs at some big companies, at the latest count, there wasn't a single black CEO in a FTSE 100 company. At the other end of the pay scale, however, black people are overrepresented in lower-paying jobs. The group meet someone who won one of the UK's biggest race discrimination payouts in recent years and debate whether taking companies to task or race-based quotas could be the way forward. One of the panel from last year's controversial race commission report also drops in to discuss whether or not racism is still the most significant barrier holding back progression for black people in Britain.

29-year-old NHS doctor Raphel has matters of the heart on his mind.  He's at a stage in life where he's looking to settle down and feeling the pressure to marry within the black community, so he wants to ask the group whether race should matter when it comes to love. Black men in Britain marry outside their race far more than white and Asian men, but black women are statistically more likely than black men to be in same-race relationships. To find out more, some of the group head off for a night out at a diverse dating event in the West Midlands to meet other single people dealing with the same dilemma.

Last to reveal her story is 34-year-old property and litigation contractor Lin with an extremely personal experience that is born from her mixed heritage. 1.2 million people in the UK are mixed-race, and the numbers are growing. Lin's experience of racism from both sides of her extended family has led her to question where mixed race people fit in when it comes to being black.

The impact of foot and mouth disease was felt in every corner of Wales. Major events like rugby internationals were cancelled, access to the countryside banned and schools closed in rural areas. Farmers were forced to isolate at home and tourism was struggling.

It was one of the first major challenges for the newly devolved Welsh administration, with a young Carwyn Jones finding himself at the eye of the storm as the minister responsible for agriculture.

Many people most closely involved - the farmers, the vets, the people who slaughtered the animals - have never spoken before about the lasting effect that the epidemic had on them. It is clear that the emotion and trauma they experienced is still raw 20 years on.

This film looks back at what happened. There were desperate attempts to contain the epidemic and controversy over how to deal with a rapidly spreading disease. Hard decisions were made to cull hundreds of thousands of healthy animals in a bid to stop the infection.   

Events reached a climax with the controversial decision to bury carcasses at the Epynt, an upland area near Sennybridge used as a military range. Locals blocked roads and Carwyn Jones faced his biggest challenge yet.

But what’s the reality?;"Slick Instagram accounts and YouTube channels point to foreign exchange (Forex) trading as a route to extra cash. BBC reporter Dion Hesson dives into this world, meeting a host of passionate and charismatic young educators, some of whom say the Forex training they sell will put him on a path to financial independence. But what is the reality?

Dion’s journey begins within IM Academy, an American multilevel marketing (MLM) company that sells foreign exchange education. Having paid for two months membership, Dion tests his skills on the live market. He generates a profit but realises he would need to invest thousands more to cover the fees he is paying for tips and education or to come close to making a living. Dion also explores the other side to this company, the side that encourages you to sign up new members, first to cover your fees and then to make money of your own.

Next, Dion looks at a company called FTMO. It apparently offers ‘funding for serious traders’, helping people make profit through Forex trading, without risking any of their own capital. He travels around the UK and Ireland to meet smart, driven and hopeful traders who are investing substantial time and money in challenge fees and education, with the aim of trading with FTMO. But when Dion takes a closer look at the company, he discovers that traders who pass the challenge are trading on a demo account with fictitious funds and that it is up to FTMO whether any of these trades are executed in the real world or not.

But this self-made girlboss from London’s docklands is actually a career con artist who has served time all over Europe. 
 
Mariam’s scams haven’t just targeted credit card companies and luxury boutiques. Over the years she’s also finessed close friends, colleagues and impressionable teenagers who took her at her word. 
 
And then she encountered Tamara. 
 
When Tamara found a suspicious invoice addressed to her husband, she knew something was up. 
 
She discovered that her husband had transferred large sums of money to Mariam from their joint account. And she soon realised Mariam had myriad other money-making schemes, too.
 
So began a dogged pursuit of Mariam. 
 
Using a fake alias to gather information, Tamara assembled a group of Mariam’s victims. Together, they exposed Mariam, who went to prison on fraud charges. But it wasn’t over. Every time they thought they’d got her, Mariam came back and pulled off an ever bigger scam than before.
 
In 2019, Tamara discovered that Mariam was now a senior Pastor with a notorious church: SPAC Nation. 
 
SPAC Nation is under investigation by police and the charity commission. It claims it is helping disadvantaged kids – but former members say that its leaders, including Mariam, encourage young congregants to take out loans and give huge sums to the church.

Stuart has been working night shifts at Tata Steelworks in Port Talbot for almost 20 years, but he says ‘you never get used to nights’. There’s plenty of work to keep him busy though; two huge cranes are in the harbour to unload material bound for the blast furnace but they’re both broken and while the cranes are at a standstill the costs are escalating. But there’s a delay in the spare part needed to fix one crane and an electrical fault on the other which can’t be repaired. He’ll try to motivate his engineering teams to fix both cranes by the end of the night shift.

Sian is on the late-night taxi shift in Swansea and there’s no sign that the long queue at the rank is going to disappear any time soon. Her first passengers are from out of town and in Swansea for the first time, enjoying hearing the ‘homely’ Welsh accent. Later, she takes a couple of tipsy girls home, admitting that she ‘loves being nosey’ and feels there should be a confession box in her cab where people can admit to their sins.

In Cardiff, Nathan is melting chocolate in a microwave and trying hard not to be tempted by the delicious smell to have a taste.

Tom was the son of mountaineer Alison Hargreaves, who perished on K2 in 1995. Mother and son, two of the greatest climbers of all time, died at almost the same age in neighbouring mountain ranges, both doing what they loved best. They now lie forever encased in the ice of two of the world’s highest mountains. Left behind to cope with the enduring tragedy are Tom’s sister, Kate, and their father, Jim.

In 1995, Jim Ballard took his children, six-year-old Tom and four-year-old Kate, on an expedition to K2’s basecamp to say farewell to their mother. The result was a BBC film, Alison’s Last Mountain. Now, The Last Mountain follows Kate Ballard on a parallel trip to say goodbye to her brother on Nanga Parbat. Using archive material from 1995 and Tom's own extraordinary footage taken up until the days before his death, the film explores what made Tom continue his ascent with Italian climber Daniele Nardi after the other two members of the expedition turned back.

At first it looks like yet another tragic accident, but as the police investigation gets under way, a dark mystery emerges. Who was the driver? Who were the victims? Who's lying?

This documentary is a compelling single narrative documentary that tells the story of an unlikely group of friends in a close-knit community in Hampshire, who find themselves at the centre of an intense police investigation.

With access to never-before-seen police bodycam footage of the crash site, viewers are taken directly into the heart of the aftermath of a catastrophic collision between a car and a tree on a dark country road. The immediate impact of the crash leaves a young man stumbling, dazed but unharmed, from the car. Telling the on-duty sergeant he was the driver, he is clearly shocked and expresses obvious concern for his friends still in the car, before asking for a hug.

As more details emerge and the young man, Dannylee, comes under police scrutiny, it's clear the events of that night have changed their friendship group forever. 'We trusted Danny, we never thought he could do anything like that.'

Emotional interviews from the family members and friends of the gravely injured teens highlight what they believe happened that night, but the only ones who know the true story are those who were in the in car. As their stories change, conflicting testimonies emerge and rumours spread

In Gloria: My Life On TV, she looks back at her extraordinary career and reveals what it has been like to be woman, a mother and a grandmother on television and radio for more than half a century.

Speaking candidly about her personal life, Gloria reveals how she survived personal tragedies such as the loss of her beloved daughter Caron to cancer in 2004 and how, from the darkness, came the establishment of a foundation in Caron’s name that has raised thousands of pounds for hundreds for cancer charities.

He decides to speak to somebody who actively chooses to remove technology from their life as much as is realistically possible, to see how connected they feel. He finds Hamish, a young man who makes Pictish crafts, who takes Duncan to a secret loch to go rowing in coracles and to camp overnight by the fire the way the Picts used to.

Duncan then heads off to meet Michelle, a fashion blogger from Kenya who now lives in Perth. With more than 11,000 followers on Instagram, Duncan asks how she stays connected with all of her followers.

Duncan's next stop is to meet young painter Ellis O'Connor, a millennial living on North Uist. Ellis is happy in her own company and thrives in isolation, and she shows Duncan the benefits of getting out of the city to a smaller community where people look out for each other.

With loneliness being listed as the number one fear of young people today, Duncan wonders what you do if you want to make a new friend. It’s often harder to meet people as you age, so he tries advertising for a new friend using friendship apps, which leads him to meet Dana. The pair meet up to see a film - but is making this new connection worth it, or is it just awkward and uncomfortable?

Reporter Linda Adey investigates the experiences of black and ethnic minority students at British unis and examines what happens when victims of racist abuse at university want to complain.

Linda’s journey starts in Manchester, where a 19-year-old student was held up against a wall by university security staff demanding to see his ID because, according to the student, they think he is a drug dealer and not a university student.

Linda’s investigation also leads her to students who experienced alleged racism at one Oxford college, Christ Church.

More generally, Linda asks whether the distress of initial racist incidents is being compounded by the way universities handle complaints. She hears that the majority of students who face racism don’t report it, but some students who do complain say they’re locked out of the process, left dissatisfied and have been failed by their university. Those students say it has had huge consequences for their mental wellbeing and educational outcomes.

But she's on the hunt for the everyday heroes of the crisis. 

Stuck in her flat but armed with social media and a network of contacts, Stacey reaches out to people across the country in search of those who are trying to help others. 

In Wigan, there’s Charlotte, a teacher turned scrubs maker who is making protective equipment and has a backlog of orders to fill. She’s working 14-hour days for free, managing a team of 70 seamstresses, to provide desperately needed equipment to frontline service workers. Those on the front line include people like Serena and Richard, St John Ambulance volunteers who have joined thousands of others to help the health service manage the crisis. Stacey learns what's driving people to such selfless acts up and down the country. 

There’s also Elly, a mum to be who has suddenly found herself about to give birth in the middle of a global pandemic. These are crazy times, and Elly can’t quite believe the world she’s bringing her baby into. Being a new mum is hard at the best of times, but Elly is ready to take on the challenge. 

While Brits across the world struggled to get home, some chose to stay overseas and help others. Freya was one of them. She decided her charity work was more important than coming home to be with her mother, who is at risk. While people around the world are being urged to stay at home, she is working in Greece to help those who have been forced from their homes by a different but still deadly kind of crisis. 

The impact of the disease is taking its toll, but in Croydon, junior doctor Zainab is working to support those struggling with the challenges of lockdown, and those recovering from the shock of being in intensive care. She knew that the workload of a junior doctor can be intense, but she didn’t imagine it would be like this, testing her resilience beyond all expectation. Still, she is determined to rise to the challenge. 

Stacey gets in touch with Jonathan in Glasgow. He has hit the streets to support homeless people who were dependent on food handouts that have stopped since the city went into lockdown. In just a few weeks, countless volunteers have got together to provide food every night for the homeless.

Using his tweets and first-hand testimony from White House insiders, this documentary for BBC Three explores how the president of the United States came of age on Twitter and documents the impact of his tweets on politics in America and across the world.

With unprecedented access to people in his inner circle and interviews with experts, journalists and some of his most avid Twitter followers, this documentary tells the story of how Trump weaponised Twitter and used it as a tool to shape policy, conduct diplomacy and wage war on the establishment.

From Trump’s first innocuous tweet to his early celebrity beefs, from his feuds with politicians to the extraordinary exchanges with North Korea’s leader and his continuing war on anyone who opposes him, Trump uses Twitter to tell the world what he is thinking and doing at all times. The film explores how his tweets provide an insight into his psyche and help maintain his cult-like popularity amongst his followers. And in light of the recent events and protests across the US (and the rest of the world), the programme asks whether his tweets are a threat to democracy or the mark of a president who has revolutionised the way leaders communicate with their people.

Trump in Tweets features interviews with, to mention but a few, Anthony Scaramucci, former White House director of communications, who reveals what it is like when the president turns his Twitter feed on you, Sean Spicer, Trump’s first presidential press secretary, who got caught between the president’s tweeting and the press, and Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer. 

The film also gains access to Peter Costanzo, who started Donald Trump’s Twitter account and wrote his first ever tweet, Sam Nunberg, former political consultant to Donald Trump, who was part of a team who helped Trump build a loyal following with a series of conservative tweets, including fuelling the conspiracy theory falsely claiming that Barack Obama had a fake birth certificate, Lauren Batchelder, who endured a sustained tirade of online abuse after she questioned Trump about his attitudes to women at a political event, and Emmy Bengtson, deputy social media director to the Hillary Clinton campaign, who wrote Hillary Clinton’s tweets during the ‘Delete Your Account’ Twitter battle between Clinton and Trump.

The issue has never received so much media attention, but the debate about what is and isn't appropriate in the workplace continues. A hand on someone's back, complimenting their fragrance - is this a colleague being friendly, or are they crossing a line? What constitutes sexual harassment?

To find out, BBC Three conduct a social experiment, hosted by journalist and presenter Ben Zand. They bring together 20 people between the ages of 18-30 to see if they understand the rules of behaviour in the workplace. Over the course of two days, they watch a specially written drama in three parts telling the story of a professional relationship between a man and woman at work which ends with an accusation of sexual harassment. At each stage, the group are given the opportunity to vote on the behaviour displayed and if it is offensive or unwanted, before finally voting if they believe it constitutes sexual harassment.

They also hear directly from people whose lives have been affected by sexual harassment, including a false accusation of harassment.

The debate between the young people is wide ranging and impassioned. The programme reveals just how much confusion and disagreement there is when it comes to specifying exactly where a line should be drawn - a line which can become blurred. It shows the significant differences that exist between the genders when it comes to their perspective on what is acceptable.

In this episode, Livvy gains access to a gang getting ready to target the UK festival scene with MDMA and cocaine.

The gang reveals that for a dealer, festival season and the illicit drug market it attracts is like Christmas. The gang buys up to 20 festival tickets in bulk, wraps and distributes drugs to event-ready dealers and plans the logistics for a military-style festival takeover.

Livvy meets the gang, gaining an understanding of each role they take in the business of flooding festivals with drugs. One prepares the drugs for the festivals and distributes them to his most trusted dealers, co-ordinating the gang’s workers; another stashes knives on the event ground before the festival barriers are set up; and another brings in and sells drugs, evading police and security, and wielding knives to fend off rival gangs.

Super-strength MDMA is on the rise in the UK. In the last two years, there have been 12 confirmed drug-related deaths inside UK festivals. Livvy goes undercover inside festivals and encounters dealers selling openly despite the heavy security presence.

But its impact on society is increasingly being questioned as governments step up efforts to regulate social media networks. 

This is the first documentary to examine the app’s effects on users since whistleblower Frances Haugen disclosed internal company research proving Facebook, now known as Meta, was aware of Instagram’s role in exacerbating issues around body image and self-harm for younger users. Meta says the research shows the majority of its users have a positive experience on the platform.

Haugen and a number of former Instagram and Facebook insiders, many speaking on camera for the first time, speak candidly about life inside the company. They reveal details of pivotal moments, such as Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012, and explain how these decisions shaped Instagram and its values. 

The power of the platform is also explored through revealing testimonies from three British users: Lauren, Chenade and Abby. With unflinching honesty, they describe how their lives have been impacted by the app. Lauren was on Instagram for 13 hours per day and found herself increasingly struggling with an eating disorder. Chenade decided to get a Brazilian butt lift, one of the most dangerous cosmetic surgeries in the world, and promote it to her Instagram followers, only to regret her decision soon after.

The brainchild of Jerry Dammers saw dance music with a message dominate the charts from 1979.;"Using music, archive and new interviews this is the story of 2 Tone – a unique musical phenomenon that exploded out of Coventry in the summer of 1979.  2 Tone not only dominated the charts and got the nation dancing to a ska beat, it played a vital part in the movement against racism in Britain and beyond. Including a rare interview with Jerry Dammers, the architect of 2 Tone, and contributions from other key players, the film explores the music style and ethos of the genre, and charts the remarkable story of how this independent ‘do it yourself’ record label from Coventry, went on to have a global impact and a unique place in popular music. 2 Tone’s distinctive look and sound, heavily influenced by 1960s Jamaica, was the brainchild of Jerry Dammers, founder and keyboard player of The Specials. Along with fellow Coventry band The Selecter, The Specials spearheaded 2 Tone from their hometown. The record label also went on to launch the careers of other bands too including Madness and The Beat. 

Jerry Dammers reveals how he came up with the ideas behind the 2 Tone revolution. Calling for unity at a time of growing racial tension in the UK, this was music with a message, featuring multiracial bands. With the unlikely blend of Jamaican ska and punk rock, the film explores how a brand-new musical genre came seemingly out of nowhere and went mainstream overnight as legions of fans adopted the rude boy/girl  image and propelled the bands up the charts. It also considers why Coventry was the perfect place for the movement to begin. But it wasn’t just about the message – it was about fun, and live gigs renowned for their energy. The last 2 Tone release, ‘Nelson Mandela’ by The Special AKA  saw Jerry Dammers'  anti-racist message go onto a global stage and was in his words, ‘the culmination of 2 Tone’. 

The film also hears from Jerry’s bandmate in The Specials, Neville Staple;  Pauline Black and Neol Davies of The Selecter, proud Coventrian and one time Special’s manager Pete Waterman and 2 Tone fan and film director Gurinder Chadha. Recalling significant rehearsals, gigs and photoshoots, Neville Staple and Neol Davies reminisce together in the original Coventry locations which have long since changed use; The Locarno, one-time hub of Coventry nightlife and scene of raucous gigs is now the Central Library.

But police found evidence relating to more than 200 victims, many of whom remain unidentified.

With exclusive access to Greater Manchester Police's 2017-19 investigation, this film tells the story of serial male rapist Sinaga’s conviction - the biggest rape case in British legal history. From his flat on Princess Street, Manchester, mature student Reynhard Sinaga would target lone men who’d been on a night out and invite them into his home, with the offer of somewhere to have a drink or to call a taxi. But instead, once they were inside, he would drug, assault and rape them, recording the attacks and collecting personal belongings as ‘trophies’ from his victims.

Investigators found evidence of more than 200 victims, and many had no recollection of being abused until a police officer knocked on their door to tell them they’d been attacked and filmed. Some of these men still have not been identified. He had been offending for a decade.

";Return to the Bonfire combines voices of people from the Greater Shankill area to articulate a wide variety of different perspectives during a pivotal year for the community.  ;"For Northern Ireland’s Unionists the 11th and 12th of July are a time of bonfires and parades and two days of the year of huge cultural and political significance.

In 2004, a documentary was filmed for BBC Northern Ireland in Springmartin and Highfield in the Greater Shankill area of Belfast. The Bonfire followed the building of a traditional bonfire by young people, hearing from both them and the older members of the community about their lives. It is remembered by many as an authentic portrayal of life in a working class Unionist community here.

Now in 2021, Return to the Bonfire takes us back to the Unionist heartland of the Greater Shankill area to see what changes have come to the area. In Highfield, the old bonfire field is now a state-of-the-art football pitch, and mixed marriages are now commonplace. Yet while change has undoubtedly come, unionist culture and politics remain central to many people’s lives. We see how the building of the ‘boney’ is still a crucial rite of passage for the young men of the area and watch as NI centenary celebrations are enjoyed, despite uncertainty about the future. Further down the Shankill Road, there are strongly-held views on peace building between unionist and nationalist communities as well as the controversial Northern Ireland Protocol.

Then years on an email sets her on a journey back to her past to find them.;"Charlie Webster is a broadcaster and journalist. She’s covered the world’s biggest sporting events. But there is one story she’s never been able to tell.

When she was 12, Charlie joined an all-girls running group in Sheffield. Running became her passion and escape, and the girls in her running group were her best friends. It was a dream.

But all that time their sports coach was abusing her. She never spoke to any of her friends about what was happening to her.

'It became my own secret that I pushed really far down, but I carried it with me everywhere'.

When Charlie was 19, their coach was arrested and convicted. He was sent to prison for 10 years.

And it was only then that she realised she wasn’t the only one he’d abused No-one had ever spoken to Charlie about it – not the police, not the athletics club – no-one.

She left Sheffield and didn’t speak to any of her friends again. To this day she doesn’t know what they went through. She has no idea who spoke up, or who else was abused by their coach.

Now she wants to find out. She’s finally ready to talk to them – but she doesn’t know if they’ll talk to her.

Charlie’s journey to find the friends she left behind all those years ago reveals a compelling personal story – of a tight-knit group of teenagers pushed apart by a predator who operated in plain sight. As Charlie finds each member of her old running group, she discovers what happened to them. Each discovery reveals a different side to their collective story. The more friends Charlie finds, the more she is able to piece back her past to really understand what happened to her.

But there is another question that needs answering – how was this allowed to happen? 

As she digs deeper into her own past, Charlie wants to find out if what happened to her and her friends could happen again. She wants to know how young athletes are protected now. 

What she discovers is that abuse is still happening today – and the system is still failing young athletes, in exactly the same way.  And that is something Charlie is determined to stop. 

Finding the friend who spoke out, whose testimony convicted their coach, brings Charlie the final answers she’s been searching for. 

And bringing the friends back together who haven’t spoken in decades, enables them to find the support and friendship that was taken from them all those years ago";Documentary;BBC THREE;Contains upsetting scenes.;2021;59;documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09w572w.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09w572w.jpg;charlie webster broadcaster journalist ’ covered world ’ biggest sporting event one story ’ never able tell 12 charlie joined allgirls running group sheffield running became passion escape girl running group best friend dream time sport coach abusing never spoke friend happening became secret pushed really far carried everywhere charlie 19 coach arrested convicted sent prison 10 year realised ’ one ’ abused noone ever spoken charlie – police athletics club – noone left sheffield ’ speak friend day ’ know went idea spoke else abused coach want find ’ finally ready talk – ’ know ’ talk charlie ’ journey find friend left behind year ago reveals compelling personal story – tightknit group teenager pushed apart predator operated plain sight charlie find member old running group discovers happened discovery reveals different side collective story friend charlie find able piece back past really understand happened another question need answering – allowed happen dig deeper past charlie want find happened friend could happen want know young athlete protected discovers abuse still happening today – system still failing young athlete exactly way something charlie determined stop finding friend spoke whose testimony convicted coach brings charlie final answer ’ searching bringing friend back together ’ spoken decade enables find support friendship taken year ago;11

That summer was the peak of his career – competing against able-bodied athletes in the 400 metres and qualifying for the semi-finals, a remarkable achievement. A few weeks later, he faltered at the Paralympics. Rather than the victory lap expected, he was beaten and afterwards was ungracious about the loss. 

The following months saw Pistorius change. He became involved with a different crowd, whilst growing infatuated with guns and paranoid about security. At this point, he also met Reeva, the start of a whirlwind romance on the surface that would soon end with him murdering her. 

In the witness stand, Pistorius stumbles in his response to tough questioning. When the verdict for manslaughter comes, the judge calls Pistorius a 'very poor witness'.

Castaway;Following Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong-Jones at the start of their married life;Intimate series profiling Princess Margaret. The second film finds Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong-Jones at the start of their married life in the early 1960s.;"The second film in this intimate portrait finds Princess Margaret and her husband Anthony Armstrong-Jones at the start of their married life in the early 1960s. At home with celebrities and artists, they are riding the wave of a cultural and sexual revolution that is transforming Britain.

In 1965, they set off on an official royal tour of the United States. From California to small-town Arizona, the royal couple promote Britain by day and party by night. They attend a dinner with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in a world where Hollywood royalty increasingly competes with the real thing. In Britain, the press starts to ask if the extravagant royal tour is a good way to spend public money. The mystique of monarchy is being increasingly undermined by the emergence of a more open and egalitarian society.

In the years that follow, Anthony Armstrong-Jones begins to withdraw from royal duties and the couple lead increasingly separate lives. Press speculation about the state of their marriage intensifies. In the 1970s Margaret retreats more and more to the Caribbean island of Mustique in an attempt to secure a private life. In an era of celebrity gossip and the telephoto lens, her relationship with a younger man and beach parties with rock stars like Mick Jagger lead to ever more press interest. As Britain lurches from one economic crisis to the next, Margaret's Caribbean lifestyle becomes the lightning rod for republican attacks on the monarchy.

In 1978, Margaret reflects changing attitudes sweeping the country and gets a divorce. The rebel royal is now increasingly eclipsed by a new generation of princesses. But in her own way, Princess Margaret helped pave the way for them and for the monarchy of the 21st century.

After returning to his childhood home for the first time in 50 years to revisit his past, Ian decides to travel across the UK to meet other people who have experienced domestic abuse in their childhoods, as well as to meet professionals to talk through his own trauma. Ian discovers how things have changed since he grew up in the 1970s, and he finds out how children are supported in the UK today by visiting his former primary school and observing local and charity-led initiatives.

The men in this film have waived their anonymity to speak publicly for the first time. Some have never told their families. And all have the same burning question: Why did he do it?

These multiple perspectives build a gripping account of how, over 18 months, Daryll Rowe set out on a dangerous, nationwide campaign to trick men into having unprotected sex with him. We hear first-hand how he would lie about his HIV status, sabotage condoms and later send abusive text messages taunting them with the virus: ‘You have HIV. Lol.’ A total of 24 men reported him to the police, but nobody knows how many others Daryll Rowe slept with.

Through candid and revealing testimonies, we not only explore the devastating effect of psychological abuse, but also the resilience of ordinary people. Alongside the men, we follow Daryll Rowe’s foster mother, Jacqui, as she tries to come to terms with - and to understand - her son’s crimes. But there is only one person who really has the answer: Daryll Rowe himself. Are we any closer to finding out why he did it?

Irish whiskey is now enjoying a 21st-century renaissance, with the fastest-growing spirit sales in the world. Once a global player, whose industrial success was almost forgotten, it is a drink with a chequered past.

Ulster and Northern Ireland are at the heart of this story - from the Kingdom of Dalriada and the poitin masters of Donegal, to Northern Ireland’s 21st-century pioneers currently resurrecting the brands and blends once counted among the most famous whiskeys in the world.

Though Belfast’s industrial golden age is more often associated with shipbuilding and linen production, Mark and Fionnan reveal just how significant a role whiskey had in the growth of Belfast.

The film uncovers forgotten links between Ulster’s whiskey makers and those of Scotland, revealing just how much Scotland’s whisky story owes to the north of Ireland, and looking back to a time when Irish whiskey exports outsold Scotch by three to one.

Graphic designer Mark’s fascination with branding and advertising opens a door on our industrial past, as he discovers just how much the story of whiskey connects with the history and heritage of the Ulster-Scots.

Despite numerous assessments, the relevant authorities decided that she was able to live an independent life without any support. 

Beginning with her vicious murder, Gemma: My Murder tells the story of her short life from her struggles with school to her determination to live independently like any other young person. Through her mother, Sue, sister, Nikki, niece Taylor, friends and others who knew her, we discover a lively, loving, if challenging young woman who adored children and loved pop music. Aged 25, Gemma moved into her own flat and her family were pleased to see that she had some new friends. But her learning difficulties left her vulnerable to exploitation by this group who befriended her, taking her money, using her flat to store illegal drugs and coercing her into shoplifting on their behalf.

Her right leg was amputated from the knee down, and she had to learn to walk again using a prosthetic limb. Despite this, she felt lucky to be given a chance to live and a week after being discharged from hospital, was signed as a model.

The Girl with the Colourful Leg follows Bernadette, now 25, as she takes part in a fashion shoot for Elle magazine and makes history as the first amputee to compete in the final of Miss Northern Ireland. The programme also hears in her own words the ways her diagnosis has changed her for the better and how she now views her 'robot foot' as a piece of art, customising it and regularly changing its colour with the help of a vinyl car wrapping company.

 As soon as Bernadette was diagnosed, she decided to tell her story to try to help other young people and families who might be in a similar position. She recorded a video showing her reaction to her diagnosis and since then, her positive social media posts and pictures of her colourful prosthetic customisations have gained her a worldwide following.

Stephen Nolan looks back at some of the newsworthy, controversial and, at times, shocking events that have marked the first 20 years of the PSNI. He talks to members of the force who have served in both its junior and senior ranks, and to those who support or challenge the current service.

The transition from the old force to the new was shrouded in controversy. Charges of betrayal both of the RUC as a force and of the hundreds of former officers who had been killed in the Troubles marked its inception. Other changes included a different name and insignia for the new service; affirmative action that would ensure a demographic balance between Protestant and Catholic officers in its ranks; and the abolition of the RUC Special Branch – at that time, one of the world’s most experienced counter-terrorism agencies.

Stephen talks to the architects of the new force. Sir Chris Patten outlines the political context, and Sir Ronnie Flanaghan, the last chief constable of the RUC and the first chief constable of the PSNI, gives a first hand account about the transition. Officers, both former and present, chart the establishment of the new service and critics of the force tell Stephen of their concerns.

Philipp Tanzer is a former gay porn actor who now works as a hairdresser, artist and gallery owner in the Scottish Highlands. 

He has been involved in the men’s rights movement for over 2 years, first attending the International Conference on Men’s Issues in London in 2018. It’s a summit where men and women who believe men are at a disadvantage in modern society convene to share their thoughts and a common ground.

Intrigued by the concept and the issues surrounding it, BBC journalist Alvaro Alvarez travelled with Philipp to the same Conference, this time in Chicago in August of last year, in an attempt to get under the skin of this movement and ultimately Philipp’s investment and fascination with it. 

For Alvaro, confronted with a confusing setting where amongst other things domestic violence towards women is being downplayed by university professors; conversely Philipp is openly captivated, yet it soon emerges there is more to his own back story than meets the eye.

As part of his journey Philipp also meets with Graham Goulden, a retired police officer and Chief Investigator with over 30-years’ experience, who now works as a violence prevention trainer. Having had numerous heated exchanges on social media, Philipp and Graham agree to meet in person to talk through their alternate stances when it comes to men’s rights and their role in society. 

We also hear from Tracie Farrell, a Research Associate with the Knowledge Media Institute, part of the Open University, who through her work has been delving into what has become known as the ‘manosphere’, a platform evolving within society where it is becoming easier to have a misogynistic opinion and vocalise it. 

It goes against most logical thinking, but are we really starting to ‘flip the narrative’ so that women hold the power and men are subjugated by it?

Richard Macer infiltrates the endangered world of bells, beer and beards to discover an unlikely saviour of this ancient masculine tradition in the form of women.

The Morris Ring, the oldest Morris organisation in the country, has voted to admit women dancers for the first time with the hope that its member sides - as the teams are called - might stem the tide of declining numbers.  But there are hardliners who believe females will dilute the very essence of what makes men’s Morris great.  So, is Morris better when danced just by men or are women and mixed sides just as good?

During this journey, Macer is invited to join his local side the Manchester Morris Men, where the average age is over 70.  Macer might represent an injection of youth to this team but does he have the talent to perform at one of the biggest festivals in the Morris Ring calendar?

What emerges during a long hot summer of folk dance is a bitter conflict as one of Britain’s most enduring traditions tries to reconcile itself to the modern world of gender equality.  It also becomes a fascinating meditation on the nature of masculinity in a society in thrall to the idea of political correctness.

Her posts range from silly dances and impressive singing to more serious issues like mental health and body positivity. With a following of 735,000 TikTok followers, she continues to build her social media presence as she balances brand deals and legal contracts with her normal life as a teenager.

Integral to Kristen’s fledgling career is her mum, Elizabeth. Trying to find a balance between protecting her daughter, supporting her and getting pigeon-holed as a ‘momager’, Elizabeth offers an alternative perspective on the impact of having a social media star in the family.

Industry experts Suhit Amin and Aundrea Worsley offer a glimpse into the up-and-coming but lucrative industry of social media marketing, providing a better understanding of what kind of career Kristen could potentially have if she works hard and plays her cards right.

However, it's not all glamour as Kristen is bullied, both online and in-person, for her social media. Does she have thick enough skin to make it as an influencer, or will the hate and pressures make her rethink her choice?

Kristen also openly discusses how lonely this career sometimes is and how Covid-19 has exacerbated this feeling of disconnection. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel as a potential new manager offers her a spot in a Creator House, where she will live with other influencers as they wake up, party and create content.

Is Kristen ready to move away from her supportive parents to dive in the deep end of being a full-time influencer? Is this a viable career for someone who is only 16?

Coercive control is a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim. It’s been illegal since 2015, but would we be able to spot it if we saw it happening?

To find out, journalist Ellie Flynn brings together 20 people aged 18-25 from across the UK to explore if they know what coercive control actually is. Over two days, the group watches a specially-written drama telling the story of the relationship between Rachel and Alex. As the drama progresses, it becomes clear that there is a variety of different perceptions of the events in the story. Some think that what they are being shown amounts to normal behaviour in a relationship, while others believe that a line is being crossed.

At each stage of the process, the group has the chance to vote on whether they think there is anything wrong with the actions of Rachel or Alex. They are invited to come to their own conclusions on what they see, and must decide in a final ballot if what they have witnessed constitutes a crime.

We find out how many believe a crime has been committed. But how many are convinced that they know what that crime actually is?

Linda Adey is investigating what happens when a date goes wrong and you want to report sexual assault to a dating app.;"While dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and Hinge now play a major role in many young Brits' love lives, a rising number of sexual assault cases have also been reported which happened after meeting someone on an app. Reporter Linda Adey investigates the safety of the most popular dating apps in Britain. She asks whether providing background checks for all users might be one way to improve safety on the most popular apps. 
 
Linda also explores the complaints processes of dating apps. She meets 26-year-old Bex, who tried to report her Tinder date, who she claims sexually assaulted her during a date. She ended up being banned by Tinder, who took months to respond to her initial complaint. According to a survey carried out for the BBC, 47% of people who responded and had used a dating app were not happy with the way their complaint was handled. Linda Adey meets a young woman, Sasha, who claims she was raped twice after meeting a date. Sasha couldn't report the incident because her Tinder date blocked her, which meant all records of their connection on the app were deleted.
 
According to a new survey carried out for the BBC, 33% of dating app users who responded have experienced either harassment or abuse by someone they met via a dating app. The survey includes women and men aged 18-35 years old.

The investigation also looks into the latest police data. More than 6,000 people have reported offences linked to dating apps between 2017 and 2021. One in five were sexual offences. The police data is supported by the National Crime Agency's latest statistics from March 2021. They found that cases have increased over the past four years, and 83% of the victims were female. But the true number of cases could be higher: according to the Office for National Statistics, fewer than 16% of sexual assaults are reported to the police. 
 
In very rare cases, a date ends tragically. Linda Adey meets the mum of 26-year-old Katherine from Wales.

Can he ever fully transition from his working-class past to the middle-class present he currently enjoys? Why should it matter where he is from? And why does his past continue to impact his present?

Using an experiment conceived by Yale University in America, Darren tests the theory that you can recognise a person’s social class by just seven words, visits the further education college he once attended to give a masterclass, and returns to ‘his’ stately home, Lauriston Castle in Edinburgh, to compare his two worlds.

Keen to experience what life might be like in the past, Darren tries his hand at being a butler with a man who has served everyone from royalty and politicians, to opera singers and Russian oligarchs.

Later, while toasting marshmallows over a campfire, he meets a young traveller in a Bedford van far older than she is to discuss two burning questions: what is freedom, and can social class ever be completely ignored?

Up in Elgin, Darren meets two pigeon-fanciers who show him how pigeons can become a way of life and unwittingly unlock a magic key in Darren’s mind.

But, as their profiles have grown, so have accusations of fakery. Can the accusers be right? Are some influencers faking illnesses for fame, money and attention?

As someone who is disabled, journalist Octavia Woodward, 23, is horrified by the thought of people faking it - but she's equally horrified to see sick people being disbelieved. 

In this film, she meets both accusers and their targets. And she meets the eminent psychologist Marc Feldman, who defined the condition Munchausen's by Internet to describe people who fake illnesses online.

Octavia soon realises she isn't really investigating whether people are faking it or not, but witnessing call-out culture at its most extreme.

In this episode, David and guests discuss the complex ethical issues that face our police today and ask whether the ends justify the means when solving crime.

Investigative journalist Fiona Walker travels to the small town of Winchburgh in West Lothian to examine the century-old case of two murdered children. She recounts the unique way in which the bodies had been preserved and how two eminent pathologists from Edinburgh helped crack the case by deducing the identities of the two young boys. However, Fiona is about to find out all is not what it seems in this horrendous case.   

Fiona joins David in the studio to show him some documents that put the whole investigation into an unflattering light. These documents are personal recollections from one of the pathologists who helped solve the case and raise some major ethical questions about the medical practices used back then and what part consent played.

David’s next guest is former deputy chief constable and SPA board member Tom Halpin. He and David look at more modern police practices that raise potential ethical concerns; specifically the issue of stop and search. David questions whether Scotland’s implementation may be going too far and whether bias profiling plays any part in it. Native Glaswegian Tom also recounts his own personal experience with stop and search as a young man.    

David’s final guest is former undercover officer for the serious crime squad Simon McLean. He speaks about his recently published memoir, The Ten Percent, which recounts his early years on the force and how he often found himself pushed into the grey areas of policing. Simon gives us a unique glimpse of the turmoil caused when the rules are stretched to the limit, where plain clothes officers must infiltrate and suppress the very worst among us - the dealers, the shooters and the gangsters. He explains that it is a job for those who are willing to do what is required, and for him that is the officers who fall into The Ten Percent.";Documentary;BBC SCOTLAND;False;2021;28;documentaries;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/352x198/p09s5cxk.jpg;https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p09s5cxk.jpg;criminologist professor david wilson present second series talk show crime file episode david guest discus complex ethical issue face police today ask whether end justify mean solving crime investigative journalist fiona walker travel small town winchburgh west lothian examine centuryold case two murdered child recount unique way body preserved two eminent pathologist edinburgh helped crack case deducing identity two young boy however fiona find seems horrendous case fiona join david studio show document put whole investigation unflattering light document personal recollection one pathologist helped solve case raise major ethical question medical practice used back part consent played david ’ next guest former deputy chief constable spa board member tom halpin david look modern police practice raise potential ethical concern specifically issue stop search david question whether scotland ’ implementation may going far whether bias profiling play part native glaswegian tom also recount personal experience stop search young man david ’ final guest former undercover officer serious crime squad simon mclean speaks recently published memoir ten percent recount early year force often found pushed grey area policing simon give u unique glimpse turmoil caused rule stretched limit plain clothes officer must infiltrate suppress worst among u dealer shooter gangster explains job willing required officer fall ten percent;11

Now the lads mags have closed and Jess has decided not to do topless shoots anymore, but images of her are all over the internet. She has no control over how they are used or what for.

Over the years Jess has received hundreds, if not thousands, of messages from men telling her they’ve been speaking to someone using her pictures. It’s Jess who bears the brunt of their frustration and anger when victims realise they’ve been conned. She has never been able to get to the bottom of why this happens, but in this film she finally finds out. It can be traced back to a collection of underground forums, websites and groups dedicated to packaging up nude and topless photos to sell in online marketplaces. In these forums, revenge porn, nudes and leaked photos from Only Fans are traded and sold. Eventually, Jess manages to find her own ‘pack’ – photos of her are being sold in exchange for a $15 Amazon gift card.

The film explores a broader online culture in which people have no concerns about sharing and trading peoples’ intimate photos, and give little consideration to whether the pictures were taken consensually.

Mamie Stuart and George Shotton;The team tries to uncover the truth behind the Brighton Trunk Murder.  ;The team attempts to use comparative forensic analysis to solve the gruesome Brighton Trunk Murder, drawing on what they already know about the death of Mamie Stuart in 1919.;"Not a great deal is known about the murky, itinerant life of George Shotton. One certainty is that by the time of his death in 1958, he had managed to get away with the murder of his first wife, Mamie, in 1919. But did Shotton go on to kill again?

Shotton was a naval engineer who wed Mamie Stuart in 1918, despite already being a married man, only to be caught and convicted of bigamy two years later. Though suspected of Mamie’s disappearance around this time – not least because of a trunk full of her possessions found dropped off at a Swansea hotel – he managed to evade conviction. It wasn’t until 1961, when divers discovered human remains in a cave near Caswell Bay, that he was posthumously sentenced for the crime. 

The case that the investigative team are looking at in conjunction with Mamie’s death is a 1934 incident known as the Brighton Trunk Murder, in which a dismembered body was found split between two trunks in train stations in Brighton and London. Given the similarities between this murder and that of Mamie Stuart, the team believes that Shotton could be a prime suspect for this murder too.

Mia begins her journey to make it to the British National BMX racing championships. It’s a slow start to the season after a long winter of rest and involves more socialising than BMX training.  

Anton, girlfriend Alisha and baby Amaiya all hit the road for their first family holiday. They drive down to a caravan in Campbeltown and realise quickly that four hours in a car isn’t quite as easy with a baby on board.

Tha Mia ag amas air Farpais Nàiseanta Bhreatainn airson rèis BMX: chan eil cùisean ach slaodach an toiseach, às dèidh geamhradh le barrachd randan na trèanadh.
Tha Anton, Alisha is bèibidh Amaiya a’ falbh sa chàr airson a’ chiad chuairt mar theaghlach. Bi na saor-làithean ann an carabhan an Ceann Loch Chille Chiarain – agus chan eil ceithir uairean a thìde ann an càr cho goirid nuair a tha bèibidh còmhla riut.

Episode four begins with president Obama's decision to launch the special operation into Pakistan, to catch Osama Bin Laden. Former CIA director Leon Panetta describes how Obama decides to go ahead despite odds no better than 50:50 and the strong misgivings of top advisors.

As his re-election campaign gears up, Obama has to make a tough choice on contraception - whether to side with the Catholic bishops, or health secretary Kathleen Sebelius and feminist activists. Obama chooses the women, and they contribute to his convincing election victory.

But soon after his re-election, America is shocked by the Sandy Hook massacre - 20 children are shot dead in a Connecticut school. The families of the victims and senior advisor Valerie Jarrett recall the president's attempts to strengthen gun legislation, but they are defeated by the gun lobby.

Obama's other ambitious reforms fared no better. Cecilia Munoz and Valerie Jarrett reveal how Obama worked with allies in Congress to create a bipartisan consensus on immigration but is defeated by the Republicans. The president can move forward only through executive action.

The background of the first black president is different from most African Americans'.

The Best Is Yet to Come;Examining David Cameron's leadership between 2005 and the 2015 election.;Examining David Cameron's leadership, from his rise to the top of the Conservative Party in 2005 to his 'sweetest victory' at the 2015 election.;"With unprecedented access to David Cameron himself, and drawing on the testimony of leading allies and critics from his close team, party and coalition partners, this second programme explores the former prime minister’s legacy as a leader, from his rise to the top of the Conservative Party in 2005 to his ‘sweetest victory’ in the 2015 general election.  

We begin at a moment of crisis for the Conservative Party, after three successive general election defeats. We investigate how Cameron and his small group of supporters sought radically to shift the party’s direction of travel, and how, against the odds, he managed to become leader in the teeth of opposition from the party’s traditional right wing, his veteran opponent David Davis and accusations of past drug use. 

The film then investigates David Cameron’s programme to reshape his party and the opposition he faced in doing so. Environmentalism, social justice and international aid - prioritising these made the Conservatives appear more electable but also ran the risk of alienating their powerful old guard. Two crises, political and personal, threatened to destabilise everything Cameron had achieved. First, we explore the extent to which the 2008 financial crisis forced a fundamental rethink of 'modern, compassionate Conservatism' in a new political landscape that demanded tough economic measures. Secondly, we turn to the death of David Cameron’s firstborn son, Ivan, and its impact on Cameron as he wrestled with his personal grief in the public gaze. 

The general election in 2010 was Cameron’s greatest test yet, and a hurdle at which he fell short. The film explores how, having failed to win an outright majority, David Cameron persuaded his party to join in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. In the Rose Garden, Cameron and his new political comrade Nick Clegg suggested that a new era of political compromise was beginning, but did the coalition stir up resentment among backbenchers who felt marginalised by the new arrangement?

The film turns to the first major tests of David Cameron’s leadership. First, examining how the implementation of austerity, masterminded by his close ally George Osborne, saw the start of long-lasting public outrage and sowed the seeds of coalition division over the introduction of increased tuition fees. Secondly, questioning Cameron’s response to the Libyan Civil War - whether his decision to intervene was the right one, and whether he was experienced to lead the country in war. 

Finally, the programme tackles the three great challenges of Cameron’s first term: the passage of gay marriage legislation in 2013, which was simultaneously the high point of Cameron’s 'compassionate' social agenda, but also the nadir of his relationship with the party and grassroots; the Scottish referendum in 2014, which saw Cameron’s government come dangerously close to presiding over the break-up of the Union; and the general election in 2015, in which David Cameron led his party to a victory that defied the polls, but at the expense of his coalition partners, the Liberal Democrats.

This phenomenon has been growing quietly for the past three years, but is now creeping into the mainstream. Reporter Ellie Flynn investigates how thousands of ordinary people and teenagers all across the world are making money from selling their own nude photos and videos.

But how many people creating content for these sites are actually underage, and should the sites themselves be doing more to protect underage and vulnerable contributors? 

Ellie meets Hannah, a 17-year-old from Scotland, who has been selling explicit content of herself since she was 16. Hannah set up an account on a site called OnlyFans using a fake ID. She was reported for being under 18 and kicked off the site but managed to set up a new profile and continue selling nudes. 

Lauren, 23, is one of the top-ranked Only Fans creators in the world. She has over 2,000 subscribers and over 400,000 followers on Instagram. In one month alone, Lauren earned a jaw-dropping £37,000 - a figure she says is going up every month.  

But not everyone is making a decent living. Some vulnerable people find themselves using sites like these to help put a roof over their heads. Sasha is 20 and earns a few hundred pounds a month on OnlyFans. She uses sex toys, collaborates with other performers and has even had requests to make videos of herself going to the toilet for £50-£60. Sasha has a history of mental health issues and turns to the local council to help her find suitable accommodation when she decides to leave home. But the council can’t help, and Sasha finds herself effectively homeless. She is left thinking about what she might have to do to put a roof over her head, and with sites like OnlyFans at her fingertips, that thought could be scary.

This is their story of surviving Helmand.

At the height of the war in 2009 and 2010, the biggest threat to the soldiers were Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) – increasingly sophisticated and devastating homemade bombs planted by the Taliban. Activated by pressure from above or a command wire, they became the single largest cause of fatalities and injuries, and an effective psychological terror weapon. 

Geraint (Gez) Jones from Wrexham joined the Royal Welsh Regiment looking for adventure. But this was not what he had signed up for. The IEDs were hard to detect and a constant threat. Gez saw what they could do to soldiers and their families. When the war was over, he felt like a failure and started drinking and using drugs. Geraint recovered after he left the army, focusing on physical exercise and his love of the outdoors, wrote a best-selling book based on his experiences and has forged a successful career as a podcaster and writer of historical fiction.

Steve Owen from Cardigan was another who signed up looking for adventure. But in 2010, Steve’s Jackal vehicle hit an IED. He ended up having his leg amputated as a result of chronic pain from his injuries. This would be the beginning of a new life for Steve and his family. Just four months after his amputation, Steve succeeded in completing a 26-mile sponsored walk. Now with three children and a happy marriage, he is embarking on an even more ambitious marathon to raise funds for Woody’s Lodge, a charity that supports veterans of the armed forces and emergency services, where he works as project manager.

Most challenging of all for families back home was the loss of a loved one. Sarah Adams from Cwmbran was proud when her young son James Prosser joined the army. James drove a Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicle at the height of the IED attacks, and in September 2009, the news that Sarah feared most arrived one morning. An IED had blown up the Warrior James was driving, and he had died from his injuries. With the war still raging, James's mother felt she needed to go to Camp Bastion, where James had died, to get some resolution of her grief. Sarah flew to Camp Bastion in June 2012, three years after her son’s death there.

Hugh Keir from the village of Crynant near Neath was a sniper in the 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment. He was trapped in the siege of Musa Qala and at the mercy of daily Taliban bombardments. Like many veterans, it took years for Hugh to get help for the deep psychological impact of his experiences. As part of his recovery, Hugh started a podcast and a rugby team - the FuBars - to help others.

This episode looks at how the family stays in power.

The film features some of those who have worked for Saudi princes. They describe how the wealth allowed lives of privilege and pleasure out of the spotlight. But the growth of social media has meant Saudis are getting increasing insight into the behaviour of their rulers, including their transgressions.

The uniquely generous social contract that has existed in the kingdom for decades has protected and bolstered the House of Saud, yet this is changing. Facing a demographic time-bomb of a hugely young population and an economy beset by low oil prices, the new ruler Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has embarked on an unprecedented programme of social and economic reform. Allowing women to drive and relaxing rules on the male guardianship system, his modernising agenda has pleased many. At the same time, his government has recently introduced strict anti-terror laws and is conducting what many consider to be a crackdown on any critics. This month, a leading a group of UN experts attacked the kingdom's behaviour as a 'persecution of human rights defenders'. 

The film also features information security experts who believe that the Saudi government uses sophisticated methods to monitor social media in order to suppress dissent and internal criticism of the regime.

Narrated by Alec Baldwin.;"Flint is the birthplace of General Motors and was once one of the most prosperous cities in the world. However, in the 1980s, the automobile industry in Flint collapsed, costing thousands of jobs and beginning a grim economic decline.

Against this backdrop, Rick Snyder rose to power on a promise to run government like a business. As Michigan’s governor, he stripped Flint’s city council of its power, and his administrators raised water prices to balance the books. They then forced the city to use water from the Flint River in order to save more money. Almost immediately, it became clear something was wrong. In many homes the water turned brown, with residents reporting an increase in illness and rashes. At the last remaining General Motors assembly plant in Flint, car parts began to rust.

Despite growing protests, the government insisted the water was perfectly safe. When Scotland-based film-maker Anthony Baxter arrived on the scene, he found Flint residents taking matters into their own hands, pulling together in a remarkable community effort to get at the truth. Hundreds of volunteers took part in a city-wide testing of Flint’s water. Rock band promoter and mother of three Melissa Mays helped lead the effort in partnership with decorated scientist Marc Edwards. Professor Edwards concluded that Flint was the site of a man-made health disaster. Because state officials didn’t treat the river water properly to prevent corrosion, it had eaten away at Flint’s old lead pipes, unleashing lead particles through the drinking water supply. For more than a year, lead had been finding its way into the bloodstreams of more than 10,000 of the city's children.
