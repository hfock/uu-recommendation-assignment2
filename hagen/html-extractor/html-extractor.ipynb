One was Stax, the other was Hi Records - a high church of soul presided over by Al Green whose Let’s Stay Together pre-figured a new type of soul man, one who would come to dominate the 70s - a sensitive lover man.\\n\\nIn Philadelphia, a new record label was born that would also soften soul’s hard edges. Philadelphia International Records was home to Harold Melvin and the Bluenotes, from whose ranks Teddy Pendergrass would emerge. PIR was also home to the O’Jays, who embodied Philadelphia’s message of love and togetherness.\\n\\nFresh from the monumental success of What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye went to work on his follow-up, shifting focus from the streets to the bedroom with Let’s Get It On. Bedroom soul was also epitomised by the sensitive, thoughtful Barry White, whose deep baritone put both black and white audiences in the mood. \\n\\nIn the mid-70s, disco became a lucrative sideline for female singers who delivered first-hand songs about love, loss and empowerment such as Candi Staton’s Young Hearts Run Free, whilst Millie Jackson did what the soul men did, only more so, telling it like it was. \\n\\nThis episode also looks at the Quiet Storm radio format, conceived by billionaire entrepreneur Cathy Hughes, targeted at a black female audience. The title was borrowed from Smokey Robinson’s 1975 album of laid-back soul ballads, and the genre helped make stars of artists such as Peabo Bryson, whose smooth ballads led the listener discretely to the bedroom door.\\n\\nThe tragic death of Marvin Gaye, on the back of his biggest success - Sexual Healing - and the paralysis of Teddy Pendergrass seemed like bad omens for soul in the 80s. But one artist filled the gap. New York-born Luther Vandross started out as one of the most in-demand backing vocalists before redefining soul with Never Too Much. Luther may have been the 80s soul king, but he did not rule alone. Anita Baker was the queen. Her 1986 hit album Rapture pursued a similar, contemporary yet retro take on soul. \\n\\nHowever, Luther couldn’t hold back the tide forever. The birth of hip hop as a political force and the arrival of MTV closed the door on soul, ushering in a new era for black music. The soul epoch may have been over, but the music never went away and, from time to time, it resurfaces in all its glory.  \\n\\nWith The O’Jays, Al ‘Fonzi’ Thornton, Marcus Miller, Nat Adderley Jr, Jerry Cummings, Charles Hodges, Candi Staton, Peabo Bryson, Millie Jackson and Cathy Hughes.

Plus as a special treat, some lost footage of the band performing 19th Nervous Breakdown on Top of the Pops in 1966 - recently discovered in a BBC documentary from the 1960s about women with depression.\",\n  'category': 'Music',\n  'channel': 'bbc_two',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '10:40pm 24 Nov 2012',\n  'duration_sec': 2639,\n  'topic': 'music'},\n {'id': 54,\n  'title': 'Vic Galloway',\n  'description': \"Glasgow rock'n'roll live from Studio 1 for BBC Music Introducing.\",\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p077gddp.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Vic Galloway, LUCIA',\n  'synopses_small': \"Glasgow rock'n'roll live from Studio 1 for BBC Music Introducing.\",\n  'synops_med': \"Glasgow rock'n'roll live from Studio 1 for BBC Music Introducing.\",\n  'synops_long': '',\n  'category': 'Music',\n  'channel': 'bbc_radio_scotland',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '25 Apr 2019',\n  'duration_sec': 588,\n  'topic': 'music'},\n {'id': 55,\n  'title': 'Boy George and Culture Club: Karma to Calamity',\n  'description': \"Film about Culture Club's 2014 reunion, as they record a new album and tour the UK and US.\",\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p02kbskm.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Boy George and Culture Club: Karma to Calamity',\n  'synopses_small': \"Film about Culture Club's 2014 reunion, as they record a new album and tour the UK and US.\",\n  'synops_med': \"Documentary about Culture Club's 2014 reunion, as they record a new album and embark on a UK and US tour, seen through the prism of the band's sometimes troubled past.\",\n  'synops_long': \"In the early 1980s, Culture Club was one of the biggest bands in the world, selling 150 million records worldwide. Formed in London, the band was comprised of Boy George on vocals, Mikey Craig on bass, Roy Hay on guitar and keyboards and Jon Moss on drums. As well as their UK success, the band was huge in the USA - notching up ten top 40 hits. Being part of Band Aid cemented them as stalwarts of the 80s, a band that broke down barriers and left a huge legacy for the stars that came later, before they disbanded in 1986.  \\n\\nHowever, they are a band with a past as colourful as their music. George had a secret affair with his drummer Jon Moss and when they acrimoniously split, the band fell apart and George descended into heroin addiction. Over the years there have been numerous failed attempts to reunite the band.\\n \\nIn 2014 Culture Club decided to come back together to record a new album and embark on a UK and US tour. Director Mike Nicholls has unique access, following the band as they first meet in George's London home to write new material. However, it's not long before creative differences and tensions from their past begin to emerge. Faultlines develop further when the band travel to Spain to record the new album, spending two weeks working and living together in a remote recording studio. \\n\\nAs the band return to London to prepare for the tour, they suffer a Twitter mauling after their first big public performance on Strictly Come Dancing. Relations are even more strained when George and the band sign to separate managers and a sudden illness threatens the whole reunion. \\n\\nThe film looks at the band's troubled past, examining the themes of success, fame and ego, and reveals the personalities behind one of the most iconic bands of all time.\",\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_four',\n  'language': 'Contains strong language.',\n  'release_date': '9pm 6 Mar 2015',\n  'duration_sec': 3545,\n  'topic': 'music'},\n {'id': 56,\n  'title': 'Northern Ireland Onscreen',\n  'description': 'Eamonn Holmes introduces soundtracks from Northern Ireland’s film and TV industry.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0b9wp5d.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Northern Ireland Onscreen',\n  'synopses_small': 'Eamonn Holmes introduces soundtracks from Northern Ireland’s film and TV industry.',\n  'synops_med': 'Eamonn Holmes presents a musical celebration of Northern Ireland’s film and TV industry, featuring soundtracks performed by the Ulster Orchestra and guests.',\n  'synops_long': 'BBC NI celebrates Northern Ireland’s contribution to cinema and television with a music special featuring soundtracks from screen works both made here and connected to here.

And, with the final on 11 July taking place on the hallowed turf of Wembley, football really is coming home this summer.\\n \\nIn We Are England, Krept and Konan, two of the UK’s most talented and successful rap artists, are setting out to mark what is sure to be a huge shared cultural moment by making a track to celebrate the England football team. But first they need to investigate what Englishness actually means in 2021. It’s never been a simple question for those of non-white British heritage, but it’s a question they’ll need to tackle if they are going to create an authentic track to celebrate the national squad.  \\n \\nBecause instead of the traditional cheesy sing-along, featuring a former soap actor or long-retired left-back, Krept and Konan are going to create an anthem for our times: representing the modern diversity and forward-looking culture in which our chart-topping rap stars and the young stars of the England team are cut from the same cloth. Rap culture is the culture of young Britain, and today’s top-tier teams now move to a whole different beat than they did when the Three Lions anthem of Euros 96 had them tapping their toes in the changing rooms and their fans chanting on the terraces. The lifestyle, attitude, slang and swagger of rap culture is replicated in the national football team – itself now one of the youngest and most diverse it has ever been – and many of the country’s biggest rappers came up honing their football skills and their rap lyrics on our city streets and in the ‘cages’ of the UK’s estates, just as top footballers grew up surrounded by hip hop culture, looking up to rap stars.  \\n \\nSo if they’re going to create a track to celebrate the pride of a new nation, it’s these stories that Krept and Konan want to tell, and this bold, aspirational culture they want to reflect. On their journey into exploring national identity, they hit the road, striking out beyond the streets of the capital as they get to know the England squad, meeting players including Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Aston Villa’s Tyrone Mings and West Ham’s Declan Rice as well as retired Lioness legend, Eni Aluko. They also seek advice from fellow artists including chart-topping Manchester rapper Aitch who they meet at Old Trafford, and west London rapper Big Zuu as they watch some football anthems from days gone by to see just how much our national culture has changed. They also go to St George’s Park, home of the England team, where they get an exclusive audience with England manager Gareth Southgate to find out what ingredients he’d like to see making it into the final song.',\n  'category': 'Sport',\n  'channel': 'bbc_three',\n  'language': 'Contains some strong language.',\n  'release_date': '10:45pm 9 Jun 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3418,\n  'topic': 'music'},\n {'id': 84,\n  'title': 'BBC Young Musician',\n  'description': 'Three exceptional musicians compete for the title of BBC Young Musician 2020.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p09g8gcq.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, BBC Young Musician, 2020: Final',\n  'synopses_small': 'Three exceptional musicians compete for the title of BBC Young Musician 2020.',\n  'synops_med': 'Three exceptional musicians compete for the title of BBC Young Musician 2020.

It is also the story of how the talents of a golden generation of artists were forever preserved on film. Nupen came from an unlikely background in South Africa and ‘ticked none of the boxes’, but seizing upon the emerging camera technology and his unique access, he filmed classical music in a completely new and intimate way that broke down the barriers between artists and their public. As a result, this documentary is also an important story about the history of music on television and the great artists who collaborated on the films. \\n  \\nNow 86, Nupen reflects on 75 productions about artists and composers spanning more than 50 years. His body of work convincingly enforces his conviction that television is capable of remembering artists in a way that no other medium can equal. Oxford philosopher and historian Sir Isaiah Berlin described Nupen’s films as being ‘at just about the highest level which television is capable of reaching’.\\n\\nThe programme cherry-picks examples of Christopher Nupen’s best work between 1966 and 2017. When he started, he instinctively blended documentary and musical performance to create a new genre of film. He filmed musicians at close quarters in their natural environment, where they have most to offer. Television picked up the exuberant spirit of the new generation and carried it far and wide. The effects were dramatic and brought countless numbers of people to music for the first time.\\n\\nA musician himself, Nupen’s musical friends were among the most-renowned artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Capturing their unique talents on film, we relive sublime historical moments with the likes of Daniel Barenboim, Pinchas Zukerman, Andrès Segovia, John Williams, Nathan Milstein, Placido Domingo, Itzhak Perlman, Jacqueline du Pré, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Evgeny Kissin and Daniil Trifonov.\\n\\nAs Nupen’s experience grew, he tackled musical ideas and the lives of the great composers.

Paloma not only returns to work after having her baby, but also to huge expectations to break Australia and America.\\n\\nA familiar presence on the London underground circuit for several years, Paloma Faith eventually broke into the mainstream thanks to her ultra-flamboyant theatrical style and retro-soul sound. Born in Hackney to a Spanish father and English mother, at the age of 18 she made her debut on the cabaret scene, singing in a covers band called Paloma and the Penetrators, before performing as a magician’s assistant and appearing in a burlesque troupe. After turning down an opportunity to join Amy Winehouse’s band, she began writing and performing her own songs, and soon earned a reputation as one of London’s most exciting and flamboyant live acts.\\n \\nShe hit the big time in 2009 after releasing her first album, which reached number two in the UK and went platinum within weeks of release. Since then, she has sold well over a million records, with three more albums released, each of which went double platinum and reached number one in the album charts. She is a household name in Britain, having been a judge on The Voice and having had roles in numerous television series and films. Now, after returning to work following the birth, she will star as the villain in a new Batman TV series, write and launch her fifth album, and, she hopes, crack America – all while being a working mum.\\n\\nThe film sees Paloma pitted against a music industry that does not always look to kindly on motherhood, and with Paloma’s unrelenting ambition, the question the film asks is 'Can a woman have it all?'

Huw  frequently spends his evenings scouring the internet for art bargains and was trawling through eBay when he came across a small, unattributed oil sketch of Jesus and the apostles at the Last Supper. He immediately sensed it was something special and was amazed when nobody bid against him. He secured it for just £50. He later learned that it had been in the seller’s family for decades, and they had assumed it to be practically worthless. \\n\\nAfter doing some online research of his own, Huw thought he might have identified the artist as Benjamin West. Born in Pennsylvania, West left America in his twenties and settled in Britain, where he quickly found fame and fortune. By the late eighteenth century, he was one of the most celebrated artists of the day, renowned for the bold storytelling of his history paintings. Perhaps his biggest fan was King George III, who made West his official history painter. Together they aimed to bring about a magnificent new era in British art.   \\n\\nHuw’s picture is an unusual one, as it is a small canvas that appears to be semi-finished. It’s partly painted in oils, but also visible are bold, black lines delineating the figures. After examining the picture closely, Philip is intrigued by it but is also worried by its condition. It appears to have been scrubbed in places, and layers of dirt have built up over the years. There’s also no signature, which, given West was very good at promoting himself and his work, is concerning. But Fiona discovers that Benjamin West was commissioned by King George III to paint two paintings of the Last Supper for chapels at Windsor Castle, and at the Royal Academy of Arts she discovers that one of the preparatory sketches for those paintings hasn’t been seen for a century. Could it be that Huw’s internet bargain is the missing West sketch? \\n\\nForensic science will be key, as a genuine eighteenth-century picture could reveal some more unusual ingredients, and West was known to experiment with paints. At her laboratory in the Courtauld Institute of Art, Professor Aviva Burnstock examines the picture and reveals some surprising details that the naked eye would never see. \\n\\nBut this proves to be one of the team’s most difficult investigations. As well as the worrying condition of the picture, they face a provenance trail that should stretch back more than two hundred years. There’s also the added challenge of doing research in the midst of lockdown. With the odds so stacked against them, can they prove that Huw’s internet bargain is actually a long-lost work fit for a king?',\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_one',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '9pm 18 Aug 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3515,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 201,\n  'title': \"Black Hollywood: 'They've Gotta Have Us'\",\n  'description': 'In the post Black Panther era, black filmmakers are no longer seen as non-bankable.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06pqm08.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Black Hollywood: Theyve Gotta Have Us, Series 1: 3.

In a post-Brexit world, Friel’s work has never been more relevant.\",\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_one_northern_ireland',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '6 Jan 2022',\n  'duration_sec': 3535,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 221,\n  'title': 'The Bronte Business',\n  'description': 'Joan Bakewell visits Haworth in Yorkshire, home of the Brontes.

In the art of Piet Mondrian, James explores how an artist who began life as a landscape painter gradually leaves nature behind, tidying up the messy reality of nature into abstract lines. We meet Chinese artist Yang Yongliang on the streets of New York, whose sprawling digital landscapes ask questions about our drive for rapid urbanisation.\\n\\nJames continues to explore this story through the images of one of the best photographers of the last century – and one of its most brilliant women - Margaret Bourke-White. In 1930, she was the first professional western photographer to be allowed into the Soviet Union, where she captured the rapid transformation of the country from being largely rural into a modern, industrial state. James moves on to explore how the destructive power of the atomic age both terrified and inspired artists in the 1940s and 1950s, from painters like Bittinger to the world of sci-fi films.\\n\\nWe then see the arrival of a new kind of art – land art. In the late 60s and 70s, a growing number of artists left the city and started working not only in nature but with it. We meet two contemporary land artists based in New Zealand: Philippa Jones and Martin Hill, who use natural materials to create sculptures in the landscapes of New Zealand’s South Island. And finally, we explore how artist collective Random International are using technology to explore our future relationship with nature – through a series of mesmerising art works.\\n\\nJames finishes the episode and the series asking questions of the interviewees who have appeared across the series. How do they see our future relationship with nature?\\n\\nHe concludes that on the long journey we humans have been on since our beginnings, artists have played a vital role not only in reflecting but also shaping our attitudes to nature. They’ve helped us understand its intricacy, appreciate its beauty, and now – when the entire planet seems under threat – they can help us forge a new relationship with it.',\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_four',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '9pm 25 Oct 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3518,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 239,\n  'title': 'Boy George and Culture Club: Karma to Calamity',\n  'description': \"Film about Culture Club's 2014 reunion, as they record a new album and tour the UK and US.\",\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p02kbskm.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Boy George and Culture Club: Karma to Calamity',\n  'synopses_small': \"Film about Culture Club's 2014 reunion, as they record a new album and tour the UK and US.\",\n  'synops_med': \"Documentary about Culture Club's 2014 reunion, as they record a new album and embark on a UK and US tour, seen through the prism of the band's sometimes troubled past.\",\n  'synops_long': \"In the early 1980s, Culture Club was one of the biggest bands in the world, selling 150 million records worldwide.

George had a secret affair with his drummer Jon Moss and when they acrimoniously split, the band fell apart and George descended into heroin addiction. Over the years there have been numerous failed attempts to reunite the band.\\n \\nIn 2014 Culture Club decided to come back together to record a new album and embark on a UK and US tour. Director Mike Nicholls has unique access, following the band as they first meet in George's London home to write new material. However, it's not long before creative differences and tensions from their past begin to emerge. Faultlines develop further when the band travel to Spain to record the new album, spending two weeks working and living together in a remote recording studio. \\n\\nAs the band return to London to prepare for the tour, they suffer a Twitter mauling after their first big public performance on Strictly Come Dancing. Relations are even more strained when George and the band sign to separate managers and a sudden illness threatens the whole reunion. \\n\\nThe film looks at the band's troubled past, examining the themes of success, fame and ego, and reveals the personalities behind one of the most iconic bands of all time.\",\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_four',\n  'language': 'Contains strong language.',\n  'release_date': '9pm 6 Mar 2015',\n  'duration_sec': 3545,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 240,\n  'title': 'Omnibus',\n  'description': \"Author Patricia Cornwell is convinced she knows Jack the Ripper's true identity.

Art makes life worth living and is the great window into human potential. And societies become civilised to the extent that they take culture as seriously as the prosecution of power or the accumulation of wealth. But in the century of total war and industrial slaughter, was (and is) that enough? \\n\\nThe cause of humanity went up in the smoke of the Nazi crematoria. Horror and terror brushed beauty aside and stamped on its pretensions. In the modern world, art has become increasingly commodified. Simon's last programme explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world. It looks at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity and turns on one central question. Should art create a realm separate from the modern world, a place where we can escape and pull the ladder up after us? Or should it plunge headlong into the chaos and cacophony while transforming the way we see it and live in it?\\n\\nUsing the works of both dead and contemporary artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, Simon seeks answers to these profound questions. His conclusion is imbued with hope: despite all the travails of the present, by engaging with the here-and-now, art still offers civilisation an insight into the incomprehensibility of the world and a way to transcend its horrors with the enduring creativity of the human spirit.\",\n  'category': 'History',\n  'channel': 'bbc_two',\n  'language': 'Contains adult themes.',\n  'release_date': '1 Mar 2018',\n  'duration_sec': 3539,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 242,\n  'title': 'Rossetti - Sex, Drugs and Oil Paint',\n  'description': 'Andrew Graham-Dixon considers the work of Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

In Snowdonia, he learns how Augustus John and JD Innes led the way, obsessively painting the landscape with a freedom and vibrancy that still dazzles today. Equally bold was the work of Gwen John, whose work is in complete contrast to that of her brother Augustus. At the National Museum Wales in Cardiff, Huw discovers how she used light and tone to paint delicate and hypnotic portraits and interior scenes.\\n\\nBetween the wars, industrial south Wales produced some of the most powerful art of the century. Huw discovers how the work of Evan Walters and Cedric Morris is steeped in their experience of mining communities and the desperate poverty they endured. The lives of striking miners were rarely reflected in art, but Walters’s 1926 portrait of his friend William Hopkins captured his subject with dignity and honesty.\\n\\nTravelling north, Huw heads out to Bardsey Island off the Llyn Peninsula, a place he first visited as a teenager. The landscape of Wales has long been a source of inspiration for artists and in the 1940s Brenda Chamberlain moved to Bardsey to immerse herself in its isolation. Inside the picturesque cottage where she lived, Huw sees her sketches of island life that she drew on the walls ‘as if they were a giant sketchbook’. At the same time, Kyffin Williams was painting the distinctive, dramatic landscapes of north Wales, establishing himself as the most popular Welsh artist of the 20th century. \\n\\nContemporary art in Wales reflects a post-devolution self-confidence that allows it to look both back and forward. In Swansea, Huw meets Daniel Trivedy and learns how his award-winning work Welsh Emergency Blanket took the patterns of traditional Welsh blankets and printed them on to the silver foil coverings given to refugees rescued from the sea. For his final stop, Huw visits Colwyn Bay where he meets internationally renowned artist Bedwyr Williams, whose work draws heavily on Welsh art history using humour and irreverence. It is a unique history, Bedwyr concludes, and one that makes him excited to be living and working in north Wales.',\n  'category': 'Arts',\n  'channel': 'bbc_two_wales_digital',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '1 Mar 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3557,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 248,\n  'title': 'The Royal Ballet: The Dante Project',\n  'description': 'Wayne McGregor’s ballet The Dante Project from the Royal Opera House.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0bj3r9h.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, The Royal Ballet: The Dante Project',\n  'synopses_small': 'Wayne McGregor’s ballet The Dante Project from the Royal Opera House.',\n  'synops_med': 'Journey through the afterlife in Wayne McGregor’s ballet The Dante Project from the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.',\n  'synops_long': 'Wayne McGregor’s groundbreaking new work The Dante Project from the Royal Opera House.\\n\\nThis reimagining of The Divine Comedy showcases the full Royal Ballet Company, as we follow Dante on his epic journey through three realms: Hell (Inferno: Pilgrim), Purgatory (Purgatorio: Love) and the Afterlife (Paradiso: Poema Sacro).

His first new town artwork was the concrete hippos that have stalked Glenrothes for almost 50 years.\\n\\nScotland’s new town artists were at the forefront of a shift in thinking that changed the relationship between art and public places. Rather than plinths and bronze likenesses of dead soldiers and politicians, this art would be found in playgrounds,  on underpasses, by bus stops, and could be seen out of people’s living room windows. The environment and surroundings of the work were seen as part of the art itself, the context in which the sculptures stand being part of what they have to say. The new town art was there for everyone, designed to define the places it was made and to mean something to the people who lived alongside it.\\n\\nMark uncovers the relationship between the new towns and their art, tracing a legacy of the approach taken by the development corporations and revealing the impact of the town artists’ work in the communities they were made for. Across Scotland, from Irvine in the west, via East Kilbride, Cumbernauld, Livingston and Glenrothes, Mark travels to talk with former town artists such as David Harding, Malcolm Robertson, Mary Bourne and Denis Barns, and to learn about Brian Miller. On his travels, he finds out how some work has survived, some has been damaged and some lost.

Can a mysterious painting of a beautiful society woman really be by the celebrated artist Joshua Reynolds? And which celebrity playwright will lead them from Rome to Bath to London’s Royal Academy? With a fascinating treasure hunt into the art of the Georgians and a very modern 21st-century digital restoration, the results are truly spectacular.  \\n\\nBendor traces the remarkable life of Sir Joshua from humble beginnings in the West Country to reach the pinnacle of the artistic establishment, becoming the first president of the Royal Academy and the country's most respected authority on art. In Rome, Bendor explores how Reynolds developed his style, known as the Grand Manner, and visiting the home of a private collector, he looks at a little-known self-portrait by Reynolds. Bendor explains why he believes it to be the greatest self-portrait ever made by a British artist, with virtuoso brushwork and a fluidity that gives it a remarkably modern appeal. Intensely personal and sympathetic, it was painted when Reynolds was at the height of his success, wealthy enough to buy a large house in the centre of London, lavishly furnished and adapted for his own needs. Bendor is also pleased to see the picture has many similarities to the portrait of Elizabeth Linley. \\n\\nEmma explores the story of the man who donated the picture, Archibald McLellan, a wealthy businessman whose passion for art saw him amass an outstanding collection, which he left to the city of Glasgow. \\n\\nReynolds's achievements culminated with his presidency of the newly created Royal Academy of the Arts, a position he made his own and which gave him an authority to promote his own opinions about painting. The suite of rooms at Somerset House in the Strand, where the academy was originally housed, have recently been restored. Bendor visits it to get a taste of the spaces that would have been familiar to Reynolds, including the Great Room, where the tradition of the Summer Exhibition was born under Sir Joshua. \\n\\nAt the restoration studio, the portrait itself has been subject to close scrutiny. At some point in the last few years, the surface of the painting had been coated with a thick varnish, which has now discoloured and darkened. However, Reynolds's unorthodox painting methods, often using wax instead of oil to mix his paints, mean it must undergo stringent technical analysis to ensure it is safe to clean it. It soon becomes clear it will be impossible to restore the picture, which Bendor feels will damage the prospects of a favourable verdict from the Reynolds expert, Martin Postle. \\n\\nEmma investigates the brief and tragic life of the woman who has always been the accepted subject of the picture, Elizabeth Linley. A child prodigy, she became a celebrity singer performing in her hometown of Bath from the age of nine. In her teens, she was regarded as a great beauty and suffered frequent but unwelcome attention from suitors. She eloped and married the playwright and politician Richard Brindsley Sheridan, and found herself at the centre of a constitutional crisis before her tragic early death at the age of 37. Emma is puzzled to know what evidence there is that the portrait is really Elizabeth, as there have been doubts expressed in the past. When she looks at some of Reynolds's vivid and insightful portraits of female celebrities from the Georgian era, she is surprised when she uncovers the true identity of the sitter in our portrait. \\n\\nTo give a sense of how the portrait would look if it had been possible to clean it, and to give his case a boost, Bendor creates a three-dimensional digital facsimile using laser scanning techniques and high-resolution re-colourisation. The portrait is returned to Glasgow for the verdict to be revealed.\",\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_four',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '9pm 7 Feb 2022',\n  'duration_sec': 3538,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 267,\n  'title': 'Flight',\n  'description': 'A child attempts to defy gravity, through the power of imagination and dance.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0bm0b7s.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Flight',\n  'synopses_small': 'A child attempts to defy gravity, through the power of imagination and dance.',\n  'synops_med': 'Step back in time to the playful world of childhood.

It’s this unlikely relationship that provides the inspiration for Afrofuturism, the broad cultural trend that encompasses works by Jean-Michel Basquiat to Grace Jones, Solange Knowles and Sun Ra. In this film, we meet, see and hear from artists across three continents who each, in their own way, explore the Afrofuture to look at the horrors of the black past and imagine alternative futures.\\n\\nThe mysterious yet influential Detroit techno duo, Drexciya, take the Atlantic Ocean, a site of death and destruction during the African slave trade and reclaim it as a place of creation and beauty. Through a series of releases from the late 1990s through the early 2000s, they envisage the unborn children of enslaved pregnant women, thrown overboard during the Middle Passage to the Americas, adapting to breathe under water and thrive in a Black Atlantis. The mythos is vividly brought to life by the Drexciyan collaborator and graphic artist Abdul Qadim Haqq as a thriving, technological undersea world.\\n\\nVisual artist Ellen Gallagher similarly transforms the violence of the ocean into rebirth and renewal. Her film Osedax, made with Edgar Cleijne, is an imaginative retelling of how the skeletal remains of dead whales sustain new life in the curious form of the bone-devouring worm of the title. Whereas for artist Hew Locke, as well as the ocean itself, it’s the Atlantic’s coastal fringes that inspire his world of bricolage phantoms, plucked from the ghost stories of a Guyanese childhood. \\n\\nThe Afrofuture is perhaps most commonly imagined through the rubric of outer space, thanks in no small part to avant-garde jazz musician and poet Sun Ra.  Born in the southern US in the early 20th century, Ra underwent an interplanetary conversion, claiming to have been teleported to Saturn. As with funk pioneer, George Clinton, who describes a similar close encounter with extraterrestrials, Ra’s identification with an alien presence can be read as more than simple escapism. It’s also a biting satire on the alienating experience of being black in America. For Ra, space is also an alternate destiny for black people, as the title of his 1973 Afrofuturist feature film Space is the Place insists. \\n\\nReaching beyond these fictional ‘Afronauts’ is the conceptual artist Tavares Strachan. His performance piece, Star City, Training in Six Parts, sees Strachan visit the famous Russian space centre to undergo the same rigorous – and often tortuous – training of the Cosmonauts. Strachan likens one of the exercises, which measures our capacity to withstand disorientation and gravitational stress, to his impoverished upbringing in The Bahamas. \\n\\nThe film concludes with an exploration of the idea of double consciousness. Coined in the early 20th century by WEB Du Bois, the influential African American sociologist, double-consciousness describes how black people in western societies see themselves twice over. Through their lived experience but also how they’re perceived within a dominant white culture.\\n\\nCurator and writer Ekow Eshun traces uses of the idea through Ralph Ellison’s lauded mid-20th-century novel Invisible Man, and painter Kerry James Marshall’s image of the same title, right up to the Black Lives Matter movement. Predicated upon recordings of anti-black violence often captured through digital tech, Eshun argues these ‘expose’ a double consciousness at work, the world as experienced and seen through black eyes, laid bare for all to witness. \\n\\nOther artists and commentators featured in the programme include Nuotama Frances Bodomo, Aria Dean, Ayesha Hameed, Kiluanji Kia Henda, Shabaka Hutchings, Elvira Dyangani Ose, Cauleen Smith and Greg Tate.',\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_four',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '23 May 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3480,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 274,\n  'title': 'Manchester International Festival',\n  'description': 'The festival opens with an invitation to join Mancunians for a self-portrait of the city.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p057db8b.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Manchester International Festival, MIF 2017: What Is the City but the People?',\n  'synopses_small': 'The festival opens with an invitation to join Mancunians for a self-portrait of the city.',\n  'synops_med': 'The festival opens with an invitation to Piccadilly Gardens to join friends, neighbours and total strangers for a self-portrait of the city.',\n  'synops_long': 'Manchester International Festival opens with an invitation to Piccadilly Gardens to join friends, neighbours and total strangers for a self-portrait of the city.\\n\\nRaised high above the pavements, a unique selection of individuals from across Manchester walk along a 100-metre runway.',\n  'category': '',\n  'channel': 'bbc_webonly',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '29 Jun 2017',\n  'duration_sec': 4400,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 275,\n  'title': 'Listening through the Lens: The Christopher Nupen Films',\n  'description': 'A film about Christopher Nupen, a pioneering director of films about classical music.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p09xh28z.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Listening through the Lens: The Christopher Nupen Films',\n  'synopses_small': 'A film about Christopher Nupen, a pioneering director of films about classical music.',\n  'synops_med': 'Documentary about Christopher Nupen, a pioneering film director who championed classical music on television, seizing upon his unique access to a golden generation of musicians.',\n  'synops_long': 'A tribute to Christopher Nupen, who became Britain’s first independent television producer in the 1960s at the dawn of the documentary era. It is also the story of how the talents of a golden generation of artists were forever preserved on film. Nupen came from an unlikely background in South Africa and ‘ticked none of the boxes’, but seizing upon the emerging camera technology and his unique access, he filmed classical music in a completely new and intimate way that broke down the barriers between artists and their public. As a result, this documentary is also an important story about the history of music on television and the great artists who collaborated on the films. \\n  \\nNow 86, Nupen reflects on 75 productions about artists and composers spanning more than 50 years. His body of work convincingly enforces his conviction that television is capable of remembering artists in a way that no other medium can equal. Oxford philosopher and historian Sir Isaiah Berlin described Nupen’s films as being ‘at just about the highest level which television is capable of reaching’.\\n\\nThe programme cherry-picks examples of Christopher Nupen’s best work between 1966 and 2017. When he started, he instinctively blended documentary and musical performance to create a new genre of film. He filmed musicians at close quarters in their natural environment, where they have most to offer. Television picked up the exuberant spirit of the new generation and carried it far and wide. The effects were dramatic and brought countless numbers of people to music for the first time.\\n\\nA musician himself, Nupen’s musical friends were among the most-renowned artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Capturing their unique talents on film, we relive sublime historical moments with the likes of Daniel Barenboim, Pinchas Zukerman, Andrès Segovia, John Williams, Nathan Milstein, Placido Domingo, Itzhak Perlman, Jacqueline du Pré, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Evgeny Kissin and Daniil Trifonov.\\n\\nAs Nupen’s experience grew, he tackled musical ideas and the lives of the great composers. His films represent a single-minded dedication to sharing the power of music that will leave a legacy of lasting value.',\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_four',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '9pm 3 Oct 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 5398,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 276,\n  'title': 'Coventry Cathedral: Building for a New Britain',\n  'description': 'The story of the 1962 rebuilding of Coventry Cathedral after its destruction in WWII.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p09kltqr.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Coventry Cathedral: Building for a New Britain',\n  'synopses_small': 'The story of the 1962 rebuilding of Coventry Cathedral after its destruction in WWII.',\n  'synops_med': 'The story of Coventry’s new cathedral and of the times in which it was built.

Poetic and deeply personal, Salt is part testimony, part performance and part excavation of collective memory through archive and music.\\n\\nThroughout the film, Thompson explores her painfully difficult but ultimately redemptive exploration of the Atlantic triangle, and in doing so, takes us on a cathartic pilgrimage through grief, race and identity. Darkly comic in places but also intensely sad, Salt is Thompson’s deeply human response to being both British and a descendant of a people enslaved by the British.\\n\\nCentral to Salt is Thompson’s physical performance of her monologue. She plays a character, known simply as The Woman, who pounds great rocks of salt, tells profound stories and makes wry observations. The Woman allows Thompson’s particular journey and personal experience to hold a greater resonance, representing the afterlife of slavery and colonialism. \\n\\nThe salt the Woman breaks down into manageable pieces embodies that shared experience – the labour of negotiating racism, the tears, the sweat, the healing. The salt is also of the sea, itself a character in the piece that plays witness to the atrocities of the Middle Passage.\\n\\nComplementing Thompson’s performance is a revealing, unflinchingly honest and at times humorous interview conducted by Afua Hirsch.\\n\\nThompson describes her journey, reflecting on the feelings and thoughts that defined her experience at the time, as well as her meditations now, five years after the original journey. She is an exceptional storyteller and her candidness, vivid powers of description and facility with language give Salt a raw and powerful intimacy. \\n\\nRecalled in distinct chapters, Thompson’s journey takes her by sea from Belgium to Ghana, on to Jamaica and finally back across the Atlantic to Europe. She set out on this extraordinary journey not to try to experience the horror of the Middle Passage, but to ‘sit with it’, to commemorate the dead. Part way through her journey, that grieving process takes on an additional significance with the death of her beloved grandmother. \\n\\nIn exploring the past and its lasting legacy, Thompson is also looking for new definitions of home on the three continents she visits, having been told variously her whole life that all of them and none of them were home. \\n\\nFootage of James Baldwin and Stuart Hall, who themselves grappled with this history and its afterlife, speaks to the inspiration and comfort Thompson drew from the black cultural archive and its distinct and rigorous legacy. \\n\\nIn Europe, Selina’s place of birth, she examines what it means to be black in a country that must grapple with its leading role in, and lasting benefits from, both slavery and colonialism. Her first sea voyage, where she encounters toxic racism and the abuse of power, becomes a contemporary replica of empire. \\n\\nIn Ghana, she explores the complexities of grief and remembrance, and what it means to commemorate a history and a people defined by absence. On her journey between Africa and the Caribbean, she confronts her own privilege and power, granted to her by her British passport.\\n\\nIn Jamaica, the country of her grandparents’ birth, she reflects on the nature of diasporic identity, on an island where most people’s ancestors came from somewhere else. On the final leg of her journey, overwhelmed by the weight of history and its ongoing legacy, she reaches a point of crisis, but ultimately, she does find home. Her long journey back into the past allows her, at last, to go forwards, as she closes with the quiet demand that we reckon with the past so that we can all do the same. \\n\\nSalt is a deeply moving account of a young woman grappling with the afterlife of slavery and colonialism. The artist in Thompson creates a performance that somehow makes the overwhelming and unsurmountable bearable for her. Steeped in anger but delivered with the lightest of touches, Salt in its essence is about love and family, whether those bonds are biological, chosen through adoption or simply the bonds inherent within the black community. In exposing her pain, and her path towards healing, Thompson lays bare a rare yet vital truth.',\n  'category': 'Arts',\n  'channel': 'bbc_four',\n  'language': 'Contains language which may offend.',\n  'release_date': '9pm 24 Oct 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 2733,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 286,\n  'title': 'The Joy of Painting',\n  'description': 'Bob Ross invites you to walk along the shore, with soothing waves rolling in from the sea.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0b222x6.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, The Joy of Painting, Series 5: 26.

We learn that the damage done has always been at the back of our minds, at the very least since the 1930s.\\n \\nDriving the film is BBC Scotland’s Scottish Symphony Orchestra performing a carefully selected soundtrack of work by Scottish composers old and new, featuring pieces by one of Scotland’s oldest living composers, Thea Musgrave, and one of its youngest, Jay Capperauld. We hear from some of the finest of Scotland’s folk musicians, Julie Fowlis and Kris Drever, who remind us that Scotland’s relationship with nature has been in many ways like a bad romance. \\n\\nOur narrators read passages from a wide range of sources. We hear words from Scotland’s newly appointed makar, Kathleen Jamie, and passages from poets such as Edwin Muir, Liz Lochhead, Edwin Morgan, Magi Gibson, Don Paterson and Robert Burns – evocations of Scotland’s landscapes, both rural and urban. We also hear from travel writers and journalists, old biographies of Osgood Mackenzie and excerpts of the ecologist Fraser Darling’s 1930s report on the Scottish Highlands: ‘they are a wet desert'.\\n \\nReadings from newspapers, accounts of mining, environmental protests, good summers, hard winters, trespassing ramblers seeking the right to roam. And growing towns. Changing Landscapes, sometimes abstract in places, evokes a Scotland – and a planet - which may be on the brink of environmental collapse.\",\n  'category': 'Nature',\n  'channel': 'bbc_one_scotland',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '10:35pm 2 Nov 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3497,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 312,\n  'title': 'Reel Stories',\n  'description': 'Sting joins Dermot O’Leary for an in-depth interview about his life and career.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p0b6ypxs.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Reel Stories, Sting',\n  'synopses_small': 'Sting joins Dermot O’Leary for an in-depth interview about his life and career.',\n  'synops_med': 'Multi-award-winning artist Sting joins Dermot O’Leary for an in-depth interview about his remarkable life and career, from his first TV appearance in 1978 to his reunion tour with the Police in 2007.',\n  'synops_long': 'Multi-award-winning artist Sting joins Dermot O’Leary for an in-depth interview about his remarkable life and career.\\n \\nFrom his very first TV appearance on The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1978, to performing at Live Aid in 1985, to his reunion tour with the Police in 2007, Sting’s career has been well documented on screen.

His eyesight is fading fast, and he has one more painting to complete. From his studio just outside Montrose, Morrison can hear the crashing North Sea. On the wall is a drawing of Mickey Mouse that he completed when he was eight years old, at the outset of World War II.\\n\\n‘My sight has deteriorated quite badly,’ Morrison admits. ‘And the very thought of coming in here and not being able to pick up a brush and do something with it really terrifies me.’ Nevertheless he has agreed to let film-maker Anthony Baxter follow him as he picks up the brushes again at the age of 85 after being sidelined by a series of operations. And while doing so, he reflects on an extraordinary artistic life.\\n\\nEye of the Storm is a fascinating exploration of what it means to be a landscape painter. It is also the poignant and universal story of a creative mind dealing with his own mortality, and the physical frailties that catch up with all of us. The film movingly intertwines Morrison’s struggle with old age, with his lively views as a much younger painter, captured in remarkable archive filmed more than 50 years ago. Pivotal moments in Morrison’s career are also brought vividly to life by Scottish animator Catriona Black. Indeed, her own journey to understand Morrison’s artistic genius, in order to do justice to it in the film, represents a story within a story in this multi-layered and visually stunning documentary.\\n\\nAs Morrison begins painting again, he is particularly troubled by the fact that – on doctor’s orders – he can’t paint outside. His lifelong compulsion to paint what he sees, en plein air, has taken him around the world – from Africa to Paris to Greenland.\\n\\nMorrison explains that it all started in Glasgow. Son of a shipyard pipefitter, Morrison entered the famous Glasgow School of Art in 1950. While other students embraced the overtly political and abstract art then fashionable, Morrison was attracted to the landscape painters of a different era such as Claude Lorrain, Jean-François Millet and Scotland’s own Horatio McCulloch.\\n\\nMorrison’s first major subjects were the crumbling Glasgow tenements, home to thousands of working-class families soon to be relocated to the outskirts of the city. Though painted without people, Morrison’s haunting paintings are memorials to a lost way of life, and would find their place in major museums. And his concern with documenting fleeting, disappearing worlds would become a recurring feature of his work.\\n\\nMorrison’s work then underwent a dramatic shift when he moved to the tiny fishing village Catterline in north east Scotland in 1959. Here, Morrison effectively established what would become a famed artists’ colony, along with painter Joan Eardley. As he views archive from the time, which he has not seen in half a century, Morrison relives his artistic and personal friendship with the woman who some consider the greatest Scottish artist of the 20th century. While Eardley became beloved for her portraits of children, Morrison never painted the human figure. Instead, he focused on the skies and landscape of Angus and the Mearns that would become a distinctive feature of his work. Morrison’s quest for meaning in the landscape took him, ultimately, to the least populated part of the planet – the high arctic reaches of Canada and Greenland.\\n\\n‘I had no idea what I was getting into,’ Morrison says wryly, settling into an extraordinary tale, which includes hair-raising flights over glaciers and arctic bison, and a confrontation with a polar bear, all the result of his determination to paint the vanishing arctic wilderness.\\n\\nAs Morrison returns to his studio to paint, there is a sense of time running out. His memory is now failing as well, and he needs to refer to a piece of paper in his pocket to remember the director’s name. \\n\\nA new solo exhibition of his work in Edinburgh – his twenty-fifth – is soon to be mounted at The Scottish Gallery. Despite his worsening sight, Morrison has promised the organisers one last work.\\n\\nAs he shuffles through half a dozen different pairs of glasses, he expresses his frustration at not being able to focus his eyes on the canvas properly. But as he begins painting on a pristine white board, he miraculously summons up the energy of the brash young painter he once was, his brush flashing across the canvas, leaving behind great waves of lapis lazuli.\\n\\nAs the film – and Morrison’s own artistic journey – draws to a close, there is a final moment of poignant triumph in Edinburgh. The first case of Covid in the UK is still a few weeks away. As the artist arrives at what will be his last solo exhibition, his wheelchair guided by his daughter Judith, as he greets his great grandson and a host of admirers, Morrison learns that one of his final paintings – Dark Landscape – has already sold. James Morrison would die, a few months later, at the age of 88.',\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_scotland',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '30 Mar 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 4669,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 320,\n  'title': 'Where We Live Now',\n  'description': \"Colin Ward sets out to discover the truth about Britain's New Towns.

We meet curator Jaysen Dobney of the musical instruments department as a rock musician and long-term patron asks for help with his problem, a collection of 403 guitars. Dobney is only too happy to have a promised gift of a 60s Gibson Les Paul TV Special.\\n\\nEvery department is currently calling on its supporters. In Textile Conservation, Head Curator Janina Poskrobko makes breakfast for a visiting professor. We've been with her since dawn, at home in Staten island, saying her prayers. She must find the money for an unfunded project - the rescue of an Ottoman robe. We observe as she subtly raises the issue while showing him a Renaissance cape. The professor is a textile expert and passionate supporter. Might he dig deep?\\n\\nThe Costume Institute is normally funded by stars who pay to attend the famous Met Gala fashion event, but this year they're economising. The 2020 Ball is cancelled, so 2019's proceeds must be used carefully. We follow the building of About Time as the set undergoes construction and the garments are installed.\\n \\nMeanwhile, fashionable friends are stepping up. In Detroit, America's most flamboyant private collector of couture, Sandy Shrier, opens her home, and her heart, to explain why the Met is so important to her - and why last year she donated 160 garments amassed over seven decades of collecting.\\n\\nIn London, we are with top-end cobbler Georgina Goodman, who has just taken a call from the Met, asking for help bolstering their huge accessories archive. In the mid-2000s, Goodman attracted the attention of couturier Alexander McQueen. Packing up her sketches, the designer reveals how she was charged with interpreting Lee McQueen's footwear visions, including the iconic armadillo shoe. The Met has a pair, but is keen to acquire Goodman's original sketches.  \\n \\nAs Covid keeps visitor numbers low, every ticket purchased helps keep the lights on and the building open. With no tourist trade, the Met is back to where it began in 1870, catering for locals. Citizens are not obliged to pay for entry into the museum, but Naqiya Hussein has bought two tickets. She's joining the many young people, newly unlocked but making only tentative outings, on a Met Date. Her scientist beau Cyril and she enjoy the tranquillity of solitude in her favourite galleries, though the camera is ever present. A date here is a litmus test of love. If the million objects on display can't spark a conversation, it's never going to work.\\n\\nPerhaps the greatest donation is a lifetime of work at the Met - or the possibility at least. We are with Vietnamese-American student Kevin Pham as he visits the medieval department at the Met Cloisters in northern Manhattan. He's one of 120 postgraduate interns, paid through a new $5M donation to study with a view to a possible career in the museum. The Met wants to build a new and diverse staff, and must succeed if it is to remain relevant. As Kevin says, the museum can't be the preserve of bearded old white men.\\n \\nAt Halloween, About Time opens. The annual Costume Institute show is always a blockbuster that draws in the crowds, and now the stakes are high. The newly reopened Met must show that it is still the place for fashion as art. This anniversary year, a mirrored gallery, packed with black garments from across 150 years, points to objects that are timeless in an industry now driven by constant change. We're with fashionistas as they thrill to the show, noting that even on a budget, Curator Andrew Bolton has managed to make a splash.\\n \\nPhilanthropy has always kept the Met alive and vibrant, and as the nights draw in, there's disquiet about the upcoming US election and its effect on giving. A change of administration, or the return of President Trump, might warp the delicate web of tax breaks and write-offs that underpin the whole arts world. With the fall-out of Covid and the tumult of Black Lives Matter in mind, CEO Dan Weiss gives a dark assessment of America's contribution to history. And on the night of the election itself, Head of Communications Ken Weine worries about money, staff and the fate of culture itself.\",\n  'category': 'Arts',\n  'channel': 'bbc_four',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '9pm 27 Sep 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3548,\n  'topic': 'arts'},\n {'id': 329,\n  'title': 'Culture in Quarantine',\n  'description': 'A call for action for a creative, equitable and ‘neuro-fantastic’ future by an octopussy.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p09sgymw.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Culture in Quarantine, How To Thrive In 2050!',\n  'synopses_small': 'A call for action for a creative, equitable and ‘neuro-fantastic’ future by an octopussy.',\n  'synops_med': '8 Tentacular Workouts For A Tantalising Future! is a call for action for a creative, equitable and ‘neuro-fantastic’ future by an octopussy.',\n  'synops_long': '8 Tentacular Workouts For A Tantalising Future! is a manifesto by an ‘octopussy’ for a more creative, decolonised, equitable and ‘neuro-fantastic’ future. \\n\\nBlending discourse with mythology, interview with autobiography, geomancy with geopolitics, the intimate and the celestial, this explosive collage is a retort to our troubled moment of multiple crises. \\n\\nSpanning performance, animation, interviews (including with artist Bob and Roberta Smith), text and original music composition, the 14-minute video-essay is a whirlwind of eight exercises for the body and mind.  \\n\\nPlayful yet poignant, coy yet in-your-face, poetic yet pungent, it argues that in such times of despair, art can remind us to imagine how things can be, and that each of us must play an active part.

Whether it is a local trip to find food or an epic journey to reach a safe place to breed, every traveller must work out where to go and the most energy-efficient way to get there. \\n\\nNow, the latest scientific research is helping uncover just how they do it, from creating mental maps of their environment to planning their route with precision. We are only starting to understand how these intelligent travellers get around successfully, but by studying their movements we may also learn valuable insights that could help us, like ways to manage crowd safety and to how to tackle cancer more effectively.\\n\\nChris begins by meeting Bertie and Baxter, two beautiful Bactrian camels that demonstrate how they are perfectly adapted to trekking across harsh deserts. With long eyelashes and special eyelids to keep out sand, broad feet so they do not sink, and the ability to go without water for up to a week, these camels can cover 25 miles a day, and helped humans travel and trade for thousands of years.  \\n\\nIn America, Rhiannon Jakopak from the University of Wyoming is part of a research team collaring and tracking mule deer across the state. They are finding that mule deer are constantly collecting details about the environment and their position within it, allowing them to learn migration routes passed down the generations, and even occasionally learning their own new routes. \\n\\nSome ocean migrants are also showing impressive brainpower, as Dr Briana Abhrams from the University of Washington has discovered. Her research has shown blue whales use their memories to migrate, letting them predict where and when there will be a steady supply of food all along the west coast of North America, as they undertake their epic 4,000-mile-long migration.\\n\\nElephants have a reputation for never forgetting, and it seems their memory can help them find valuable resources. Sophie Sadera is a safari guide in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and she knows first-hand how elephants use the same pathways every year as they travel to find water. During times of drought matriarchs can use their memory of water sources they have visited in the past to ensure their herd’s survival.\\n\\nBut you do not need to have a big brain to find your way around. The green and black poison dart frog lives in the rainforests of South America and is a master of mental maps. Brand new science has shown this tiny amphibian has got the mind to remember the structure of a rainforest, which is constantly changing, enabling them to transport their tadpoles to water sources within this dynamic environment. \\n\\nExciting new research by Rickesh Patel, from the University of Maryland Baltimore County, has revealed an excellent underwater navigator. By constantly monitoring the turns they take and the distance they travel, mantis shrimp can find their way back to their home. This suggests they use a navigational strategy called path integration. They are currently the only underwater animal that we know of that is able to do this.   \\n\\nProfessor Marie Dacke, from Lund University in Sweden, has been studying dung beetles in South Africa for over 20 years, and her research has discovered that these insects have the remarkable ability to navigate at night using the light of the Milky Way. \\n\\nSome animal travellers use the most surprising ways to get around, and new science by the University of Bristol has shown how spiders can fly. By detecting static electricity in the air, they float along on silk lines. They have been found an impressive 1,000 miles out at sea, and up to two-and-a-half miles high in the air. \\n\\nBut they are not the only surprising flyer, the Paradise Tree Snake can cover almost 100 metres in a single glide. Now, thanks to motion-capture technology, new research has revealed the science behind how they can glide and land safely. \\n\\nSome of the most exciting discoveries are coming from studying how animals travel en masse. Dr Iain Couzin, from the Max Planck Institute in Germany, is showing that bird flocks and fish shoals tap into a 'group mind' influencing how they travel. Their behaviour may hold answers to some human problems, like how to manage crowd safety and even new ways to treat cancer.\\n\\nChris takes us on a trip into the remarkable world of animal travel.

The difference is that science has given us a vision of the deep future. It has shown us that we live in a clockwork universe where planets turn around stars in predictable orbits, stars around galaxies and the galaxies themselves are all falling through a probably infinite universe. \\n\\nBut powerful as science is at predicting the motion of the heavens, our future is far from certain.

He gives so much of himself to her that when she dies, so will he.\\n\\nToad-headed agamas spend their lives on the sand dunes of southern Russia. They need burrows in which to lay their eggs, but this isn’t easy when their homes can be swallowed up before their eyes in the ever-shifting sands. Meanwhile, for one laysan albatross, finding a place to breed isn’t so much of a problem, but finding a partner is a real struggle. Laysan pair for life, but when there are not enough males to go around, different tactics are required. And for another iconic bird, an abundance of males leads to perhaps the most remarkable strategy of all. On the plains of Texas, dominant wild turkey males are aided by their less impressive brothers, who will help to keep rival males at bay whilst the top turkey secures as many mates as possible.\\n\\nIn North America, thousands of creatures have been hiding underground for 17 years for their chance to play the mating game. Periodical cicadas emerge from the ground in immense swarms to overwhelm predators and ensure the next generation of ground-dwellers.

This 32-acre site is a hive of activity where 1.2 million vacuums are made every year. Gregg is following their biggest seller, the Henry vacuum cleaner in bright red.\\n\\nHe starts with head of operations Stuart Cochrane, who is taking delivery of 25 tonnes of clear polypropylene pellets. They are transported to the factory floor via a spaghetti junction of pipes and then mixed with a red colouring agent. A massive moulding machine heats the plastic pellets and forces them into a drum-shaped mould under 300 tonnes of clamp pressure, the equivalent weight of 24 London buses. There are 47 of these huge moulding machines in the factory, churning out a total of 5,000 vacuums every day.\\n\\nNext, Gregg’s vacuum needs a bit of personality. The famous smile was drawn on for the first time as a joke by an employee at a trade show, but it attracted so much attention that it quickly became a permanent fixture. It is created using a process called PAD printing. Silicone pads are dipped in ink and pressed onto the surface of the moulded plastic ‘face’ to create the eyes and smile, after which it is cured under heat to dry the ink.\\n \\nWith the drum and face moulded and printed, and wheels made from moulded recycled plastic, the bottom half of the vacuum is assembled in less than a minute. Timing is crucial - the drum is still hot from the moulding machine, so the wheels must be slotted in before the plastic cools and shrinks.  \\n\\nNow for the top half of the vacuum cleaner, which starts with a moulded motor housing. The motor needs power, so Gregg meets with wiring section manager Nathan Bandy at the loom assembly station. Nathan explains that the wiring loom is a cluster of cables that connect to the on/off switch, transmitting electricity to the motor. \\n\\nWith so many electrical and mechanical parts in each vacuum, the factory has its own on-site testing centre. Gregg can’t quite believe his eyes, as everywhere he looks, they are being put through their paces. It is like a torture chamber for vacuum cleaners! \\n\\nBack at the factory, the top half of Gregg’s vacuum is coming together, and the shiny top cover is emerging from another moulding machine. \\n\\nNext, Gregg is sent off in search of a set of ‘wands’ for his vacuum, and project manager Roy Poole has the magic touch. The wands start life as 422mm stainless steel tubes which are fed into a machine that reduces one end by 1mm and stretches the other by 1.75, so they will slot neatly together to form a solid link between the brushes and the hose. \\n\\nAt last, the components can be brought together at the final assembly station, and it happens fast! The lower housing forms the base, then the motor with a jacket of acoustic wrap.

From the intense heat of the tropics to our planet's frozen poles, through to its unexplored depths, we reveal new worlds and extraordinary never-seen-before animal behaviours.\\n\\nStarting in the tropical coral reefs - the most diverse ocean habitat - a tusk fish demonstrates a surprising level of ingenuity - tool use - as it uses corals as an anvil to break open clams. In the Seychelles, half a million terns nest on an island. Fledglings must eventually take to the wing, but danger lurks beneath the waves: metre-long giant trevally fish leap clear out of the water to snatch birds on the wing.\\n\\nIn the tropics sun heats the sea, creating rain, winds and huge storms that drive up towards higher latitudes. Here the seas change with the seasons. In spring thousands of mobula rays gather in Mexico's Sea of Cortez. At night, in a previously unseen event, tiny organisms that light up when disturbed react to their wingbeats, creating an enchanting bioluminescent firework display.\\n\\nThe seasonal seas are home to bountiful kelp forests. In the undersea forests of southern Africa, one resident - the common octopus- has become the ultimate escape artist. To outwit her nemesis, the pyjama shark, she uses ingenious tactics, never filmed before. \\n\\nOn the coast, two worlds collide. Where sea meets land, coasts are the most dynamic and challenging habitats in the ocean. The ever-changing tides create rock pools. But these temporary worlds are a battleground. Predatory starfish turn a magical garden into the stuff of nightmares.\\n\\nThe big blue is the world's greatest wilderness - it's a vast marine desert where there is little to eat and nowhere to hide. Sometimes there is a brief explosion of food in this marine desert, but ocean hunters must be fast to make the best of this bonanza. We witness super-pods of up to five thousand spinner dolphins racing to herd vast shoals of lanternfish, briefly caught at the surface where it is thought they spawn. New aerial footage reveals, for the first time, the spectacular feeding frenzy of 90kg tuna and dolphins smashing through the lantern fish shoals turning the sea white with foam.\\n\\nThe deep is perhaps the most hostile environment on Earth, at least to us - a world of crushing pressure, brutal cold and utter darkness. We have barely begun to explore it and yet it is the largest living space on our blue planet, home to strange worlds like methane volcanoes and undersea lakes of salty brine. But life adapts in ingenious ways, like the sea toad - a fish that walks instead of swims. And barrel-eye - a deep sea fish with a translucent skull so that it can see through the top of its head to make the most of any glimmer of light.\\n\\nThe deep is more closely connected to our own world than we ever thought possible due to giant ocean currents. We join these ocean currents as they begin their lives in Antarctica and flow from the poles to the tropics and back again, linking every ocean. Ocean currents move heat around our planet and maintain a climate favourable for life. But our ocean system, in relative equilibrium for millennia, is changing at a worrying rate.\\n\\nDeep in the polar north, we meet walrus mothers and their newborn calves, searching for an ice floe to rest on; but with rising temperatures, summer sea ice is retreating- their battles to survive are becoming ever harder. As we begin to understand the true complexity of the lives of our ocean creatures so do we recognise the fragility of their home.\",\n  'category': 'Nature',\n  'channel': 'bbc_one',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '1 Jan 2018',\n  'duration_sec': 5280,\n  'topic': 'science-and-nature'},\n {'id': 422,\n  'title': 'Planet Earth',\n  'description': 'The final episode looks at the largest of all habitats - the ocean.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p05ccsgl.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Planet Earth, 11.

As a blind man with a passion for outdoor adventure, Amar discover how the stunning landscape along the River Nidd has been shaped, while abseiling into a hidden canyon, discovering the remains of an abandoned village, canoeing over Bradford’s water supply and meeting the local llamas.\\n\\nAmar’s 13-mile route takes in the most stunning parts of this unique river valley. It’s the place where mysterious gorges have been carved out over thousands of years, where villages have been left abandoned after huge civil engineering projects, and where the farms of the future are taking hold in the landscape. It is packed with intriguing history, stunning nature and incredible views. \\n\\nWe hear how Amar was introduced to outdoor adventure after he became blind when he was 18. Climbing Yorkshire’s Three Peaks was his first major challenge so the scenery of North Yorkshire still means the world to him.\\n\\nHis journey starts at Scar House Reservoir, where the source of the Nidd rises dramatically behind the dam wall. He starts his journey by canoe with a local instructor, paddling across the reservoir – before he explores the remains of a mysterious vanishing village that was once home to 1,250 people. With impressive archive pictures, he discovers how it housed families working on the revolutionary reservoir project which now provides most of Bradford’s water supply. Remains include the projection booth of a stunning 600-seat cinema.\\n\\nAmar’s journey then continues down the Nidd valley – where the landscape is rapidly changing. Farmer Martyn Brown has turned his back on sheep and crops, and spent this year planting 10,000 trees on his 970-acre farm by the Nidd. He is part of a movement to revolutionise the way farms connect with nature. Amar meets him to investigate how this farm is transforming the fortunes of the local wildlife – and also helps out with a spot of dry stone walling to stop the sheep nibbling the new trees.\\n\\nWalking with his guide, Amar then heads up and over the moor before descending to the dramatic How Stean Gorge. On the way, there is a brief stop at Middlesmoor where he explains how blind people can still enjoy stunning views like this.\\n\\nPutting on his wetsuit, Amar then takes on a spectacular limestone ravine carved out over thousands of years by the power of the river. With instructor Tony Liddy, he abseils 45 feet into the gorge below. With specialist waterproof cameras, they explore a hidden area of incredible beauty and examine the natural rock formations and how the gorge came to be. \\n\\nContinuing downstream, with stunning aerials and idyllic filming, Amar and his guide continue to Pateley Bridge – stopping to help catch wild brown trout on the river.\\n\\nAmar then heads to what is officially the oldest sweet shop in England. Tasting the old classics, operating the vintage confectionary machines and talking all things sweet with its charismatic owner, Amar revels in the nostalgia that brings so many visitors to this beautiful village.\\n\\nHis journey then continues down the river valley – as the autumn leaves line the path as the river widens. His journey concludes by meeting a remarkable farmer’s wife. After going to buy a horse and coming home with a llama ten years ago, Suzanne Benson is the proud owner of a llama trekking farm in the beautiful countryside beside the River Nidd. Suzanne takes Amar on a llama trek, where he reflects on how he was in Peru when he last came across one, and wonders if a llama would make for a good guide dog replacement. They finish with a scenic trek overlooking this unique part of the Yorkshire Dales. \\n\\nWith high quality drone filming, stunning helicopter aerials, shots under the surface of the river itself and bespoke craft filming, this is a high quality film showcasing one of the most impressive but rarely visited parts of Yorkshire – all fronted by a witty, engaging and dynamic new presenter.',\n  'category': 'Nature',\n  'channel': 'bbc_one',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '10 Dec 2018',\n  'duration_sec': 1740,\n  'topic': 'science-and-nature'},\n {'id': 446,\n  'title': 'Natural World',\n  'description': 'Documentary looking at a post office in Antarctica surrounded by 3,000 gentoo penguins.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p08ynk96.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Natural World, Short Versions: Penguin Post Office',\n  'synopses_small': 'Documentary looking at a post office in Antarctica surrounded by 3,000 gentoo penguins.',\n  'synops_med': 'Nature documentary looking at a post office in Antarctica that is surrounded by 3,000 gentoo penguins.',\n  'synops_long': '',\n  'category': 'Nature',\n  'channel': 'bbc_two',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '10:25pm 21 Feb 2022',\n  'duration_sec': 271,\n  'topic': 'science-and-nature'},\n {'id': 447,\n  'title': 'Greta Thunberg: A Year to Change the World',\n  'description': 'As the world is bought to a standstill by Covid-19, Greta has to put her plans on hold.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p09cyshz.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Greta Thunberg: A Year to Change the World, Series 1: Episode 3',\n  'synopses_small': 'As the world is bought to a standstill by Covid-19, Greta has to put her plans on hold.',\n  'synops_med': 'As the world is bought to a standstill by the Covid-19 pandemic, Greta has to put her plans on hold.',\n  'synops_long': 'As the world is bought to a standstill by the Covid-19 pandemic, Greta has to put her plans on hold. \\n\\nThe pandemic reveals the enormity of the challenge that tackling climate change poses as Greta learns the drop in emissions caused by the 2020 lockdowns is not enough to put the world on track to meet its climate goals.

Yet it is amongst those galaxies that we have been able to unravel the story of the universe’s creation. Thanks to a series of discoveries, our most powerful space missions have unravelled 13.8 billion years of cosmic evolution and revealed the story of our universe from its birth all the way to the arrival of our nascent civilisation. \\n\\nOur guide on this odyssey back to the dawn of time is light. Telescopes are time machines - by looking out into the distant universe, they open a window to the past. One telescope more than any other has helped us journey through the history of the universe: NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope. Over the course of three decades, Hubble has shown us cosmic evolution in action – including stars and planets being born and galaxies colliding. Remarkably, Hubble has even found one of the first galaxies ever to exist in the universe, which was born some 13.4 billion years ago. It's a discovery that hints at the beginnings of our own Milky Way. Vivid CGI brings this ancient galaxy to life, allowing us to witness for ourselves the first dawn. It was the beginning of a relationship between stars and planets that would, on a faraway world, lead to the origin of life - and ultimately to us.\\n\\nHubble’s incredible discoveries have allowed scientists to piece together much of our cosmic story, but it cannot take us back to the most important moment in history: the Big Bang. For decades, the moment the universe began was the subject of pure speculation, but by combining astronomy and cosmology, scientists have finally found a way to put their theories to the test and study the momentous events that took place during the Big Bang. They can do this because the European Space Agency’s Planck space telescope has seen the afterglow of the Big Bang itself – something we call the cosmic microwave background. The unparalleled detail Planck gave us has helped confirm something remarkable: the Big Bang may not be the beginning. There was a time before the dawn – a place beyond anything we can comprehend. Brian transports us back to the fraction of a second before the Big Bang, when the seeds of our universe were planted. \\n\\nThe story of our universe's origin is an improbable odyssey, one that helps us understand how we came to be here, contemplating this vast cosmic drama.\",\n  'category': 'Science',\n  'channel': 'bbc_two',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '27 Oct 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3531,\n  'topic': 'science-and-nature'},\n {'id': 464,\n  'title': 'David Attenborough - The Early Years',\n  'description': 'David Attenborough recalls key moments from his early career.

The native meadow comes into its own, attracting over a dozen different kind of butterflies and clouds of aerial predators.\\n\\nColin meets Professor Dave Goulson at his own wild patch in East Sussex to chat about his work on bumblebees and his crazy dream for the British countryside.

At Paradise Island, Ade finds an abandoned hotel.',\n  'synops_long': 'The final leg of Ade Adepitan’s epic tour of Africa sees him travelling from the beaches of Mozambique, through South Africa, before ending his entire trip in Zimbabwe.\\n\\nHe begins on the golden sand beaches of Mozambique’s Bazaruto Archipelago, one of Africa’s highlights. At Paradise Island, he finds an abandoned hotel, a visual reminder of Mozambique’s recent history - this place was once a high-end tourist destination, but 25 years of colonial and then civil war put a stop to development. But the local wildlife has benefited from the fact that so few tourists now come here, and Ade is able to snorkel with one of the world’s most elusive sea creatures - a dugong.\\n\\nSince the wars, Mozambique has struggled to develop, and Ade meets someone for whom life is especially hard – a wheelchair user like himself. In a country where disability is viewed with fear and superstition – and believed by many to be contagious – even catching a bus proves impossible for Castigo. The best thing in his life is exactly the same thing that turned Ade’s life around - wheelchair basketball - and Ade can’t help getting carried away in a game. Along the coast, at one of Mozambique’s largest ports, Ade finds out that China is investing a huge amount in Mozambique – and elsewhere across Africa. The money often comes with strings attached, but a poor country like Mozambique needs financial help, which has to come from somewhere. \\n\\nAde’s next stop is South Africa. The country is famous for its wildlife but Ade hears how Chinese influence is having a dramatic impact here – the country’s rhino population has been decimated by poachers, driven by a demand for rhino horn in Chinese medicine. Ade follows rangers with a surprising way of tackling the problem - by cutting off the rhino horn themselves, they hope to deter poachers.\\n\\nAde travels to Johannesburg to see how the country is faring 25 years after apartheid ended. On a tour of the city, he is upset to discover that although the black population now have voting rights, they are living in an economic form of apartheid, with 25% unemployed and many squatting on whatever land they can find. In an emotional scene, Ade visits a squatted piece of land, moments after the police have destroyed people’s houses, to hear claims that Mandela’s legacy has been forgotten. Land reform is the big political issue here today, with many calling for a redistribution of land from rich white farmers to the black population.\\n\\nThe final stop on Ade’s African adventure is Zimbabwe – where land reform has already happened, with disastrous results. Ade finds a country still struggling economically. His first stop is the Kariba dam, and a hair-raising boat ride on the vast and stunning Lake Kariba. Ade finds that locals are worried about the stability of the Kariba dam and work has begun to stabilize undermined foundations. The worrying decay of this crucial dam is a sign of how much this country suffered under the rule of Robert Mugabe.\\n\\nAs Ade has seen so often on his trip around Africa, Zimbabwe is a country that should be rich. It has huge quantities of gold – enough, in theory, for the entire population to be a millionaire. But there isn’t the infrastructure of investment to get at it - in a country dogged by poverty and corruption. But the departure of dictator Robert Mugabe brought a new optimism, and Ade meets gold miners who are willing to risk daily exposure to toxic mercury for every scrap of gold they can get and an entrepreneur who believes the industry can be transformed. Despite the return of violence and repression in Zimbabwe, Ade ends his journey on a high, visiting a remote hut that has been turned into the set of a music video. He joins UK indie musician Shingai Shoniwa as she shoots the video for her forthcoming debut single, Coming Home, in a country that she believes is on the up, and deserves a fresh chance.',\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_two',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '9pm 24 Feb 2019',\n  'duration_sec': 3516,\n  'topic': 'lifestyle'},\n {'id': 896,\n  'title': 'RHS Flower Show Tatton Park',\n  'description': 'Rachel de Thame and Joe Swift lead the team of garden experts.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06f2zpz.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, RHS Flower Show Tatton Park, 2021: Episode 2',\n  'synopses_small': 'Rachel de Thame and Joe Swift lead the team of garden experts.',\n  'synops_med': \"Rachel de Thame and Joe Swift lead the team of garden experts as this year's RHS Flower Show Tatton Park comes to a close.\",\n  'synops_long': \"Rachel de Thame and Joe Swift lead the team of garden experts as this year's RHS Flower Show Tatton Park comes to a close.\\n\\nLove will be in the air as Carol Klein discovers the ‘plants with passion’ on display in the floral marquee.

The film shows the staff working tirelessly to triple the unit’s bed capacity, the struggles coping with PPE and the toll the epidemic takes on family life.\\n\\nThis unique documentary, filmed entirely by NHS staff, presents an extraordinary personal insight into hospital life during the most serious public health crisis in living memory.\\n\\nProduced by the BAFTA Cymru-award-winning team behind Critical: Inside Intensive Care, the 60-minute documentary for BBC One Wales follows the lives of medical staff during the four weeks from the time the lockdown came into force, until the number of cases begins to level off in late April. \\n\\nFilmed on mobile phones and small cameras, the film captures life at the sharp end of the fight against the virus, as the dedicated medical staff struggle to contain the outbreak. The Aneurin Bevan Health Board that covers Newport and the Gwent Valleys emerged as one of the UK’s coronavirus hotspots, with more cases than anywhere outside London, per head of population.\\n\\nWales has fewer intensive care beds than anywhere else in Britain. This, alongside an aging population, long-standing social problems and close proximity to the urban populations of England, meant  that the Gwent outbreak was one of the most serious in Britain. \\n\\nIntensive Care Consultant Dr David Hepburn recovered from coronavirus to return to work on the unit. He says in the film: ‘There’s a huge variation in the demographic, but traditionally this has been an area of high social deprivation and particular health problems, and Newport is known for seeing more extreme pathology than in some of the more metropolitan areas like Cardiff, so not a desperately healthy population. But at the minute, we are at the epicentre of this outbreak, outside the big metropolitan areas of London and Birmingham.’ \\n\\n‘Per head of population, we are seeing more people in Newport who are desperately unwell than most areas and certainly than anywhere else in Wales.’\\n\\nEmotional video diaries show doctors and nurses leaving their families to come into work to find the unit full of patients on ventilators.

We see how the staff work together to keep morale high under incredibly traumatic circumstances.\\n\\nIntensive Care Consultant Dr Laura McClelland speaks of her hope for the future: ‘From a personal perspective, as much as the lockdown has been difficult, it’s been quite a period of reflection and prioritisation. \\n\\n‘I believe that the inclination of mankind to recognize the value of the family and the community and time spent just being and appreciating what they have, their health, the health service, is something we can bring forward into the future.’\\n\\n',\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_one_wales',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '11 May 2020',\n  'duration_sec': 3542,\n  'topic': 'lifestyle'},\n {'id': 933,\n  'title': 'Travelling Blind',\n  'description': 'Blind traveller Amar Latif sets off to explore Turkey with comedian Sara Pascoe.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p07k2vg9.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Travelling Blind',\n  'synopses_small': 'Blind traveller Amar Latif sets off to explore Turkey with comedian Sara Pascoe.',\n  'synops_med': 'Blind traveller Amar Latif sets off to explore Turkey with the comedian Sara Pascoe as his sighted guide.',\n  'synops_long': 'Amar Latif was told, aged four, that he would be blind by the time he was 18. However, his lack of sight hasn’t prevented him from experiencing the world. He has travelled extensively, visiting over a hundred countries and taken up skydiving, bungee jumping and skiing. Whenever Amar travels he relies on someone sighted to guide him. In return he opens their eyes and all their senses to a completely different way of travelling.   \\n\\nAmar is joined by comedian Sara Pascoe as he attempts to open her eyes to the potential of travelling blind and ‘seeing’ the world differently. The destination is Turkey and their journey takes them off the beaten track as they explore the country’s bustling cities, remote mountains and extra-ordinary landscapes. What becomes clear is that Sara and Amar travel in completely different ways. Sara prefers to stand back and observe while Amar needs to be in the thick of things. Their journey through Turkey becomes as much about their relationship with each other, as it is about the country.  \\n\\nAmar and Sara start their travels in Istanbul and as they navigate the city’s vast Grand Bazaar to get to their hotel, Sara is keen to guide them straight there but Amar just wants to smell, listen and touch every item in the bazaar. It is Sara’s first lesson in guiding - if you are blind then things need to be experienced, or else they don’t really exist.  \\n\\nAfter three days in Istanbul, Amar and Sara head east to the mountains along the Black Sea. Traditional communities still live here and have a long history of summer festivities. One of these is oil wrestling – a sport Amar has heard about but never witnessed. Sara must describe the complexities of large men in leather trousers covering themselves in olive oil and throwing each other onto the ground and she rises to the challenge.  \\n\\nTheir time in the mountains also gives Amar and Sara time to understand each other better. Amar opens up of how he went blind, and the impact it had one his teenage life. By 18, he had lost his sight completely and found himself trapped in darkness, just as his friends were getting girlfriends and exploring the world. Amar overcame his depression by deciding to say yes to everything and becoming an immensely positive person.  \\n\\nHowever, after 25 years of blindness, Amar is now beginning to forget what things look like. Images that were once familiar in his imagination - clouds, birds, his mother’s face - are fading.  Sara is deeply affected by this and decides to take Amar to a place that is unlike anywhere he has been before. And she plans to describe it so well that it creates a new visual palate in his imagination. They head to Cappadocia, a unique landscape formed from volcanic mud that has been eroded to create staggering rock formations. For 24 hours, Sara describes the scene in forensic detail to the extent that Amar can picture it in his mind and ‘see again’.

If they impress, the panel could book them for jobs in the future.\\n\\nThe guest judge this week is masterclass mogul Lisa Eldridge, who joins Val, Dominic and the panel to watch the MUAs present individually. each must showcase their USP by creating a signature look, be engaging, explain their techniques and deliver great make-up under pressure. \\n\\nThe next day in Glow Up Studios, the MUAs take on their final Creative Brief. They must show the judges a look that demonstrates what makes them unstoppable as a MUA, encapsulating how they have grown throughout the competition. One MUA’s interpretation of unstoppable is based on crystals, which have helped her get to where she is, using the colours as well as unconventional items such as dried lavender and crystals. Another MUA draws inspiration from MRI brain scans and endorphins, hoping his positivity pays off and showing that if you put your mind into it, you can be unstoppable. The last finalist lights up her model with UV paint, in her daughter’s favourite colour, showing her inner warrior that signifies she will always be by her daughter’s side.\\n\\nOnce the Creative Brief is over, the judges must decide which MUA has fallen at the last hurdle and which two head into the final Face Off, with only one being crowned winner of Glow Up: Britain’s Next Make-Up Star.\",\n  'category': 'Beauty',\n  'channel': 'bbc_three',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '10:45pm 8 Jun 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3520,\n  'topic': 'lifestyle'},\n {'id': 961,\n  'title': 'Life on Earth',\n  'description': 'David Attenborough looks at how and why humans have come to dominate life on earth.',\n  'image': 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/{recipe}/p06xk07c.jpg',\n  'keywords': 'BBC, iPlayer, TV, Life on Earth, 13.

After the shocking news broke that black, Asian and minority ethnic patients were dying in disproportionate numbers from Covid-19, David felt compelled to discover the reasons why. \\n\\nDavid starts his journey in Brent, north west London. During the first wave of the pandemic, the borough had the highest Covid-19 mortality rate in the country. It is also one of the UK's most diverse areas, where nearly 65 per cent of the local population are black, Asian or from other minority ethnic groups. \\n\\nHe visits Dr Tariq Husain, head of the Intensive Care Unit at the nearby Northwick Park Hospital, who describes the tidal wave of cases that overwhelmed their capacity, five times more than the usual rates of admissions, and the fact that people from minority communities seemed to be the hardest hit. \\n\\nWas this just an isolated incident? To find out, David visits Dr Guddi Singh, a paediatric doctor and health expert, who reveals that what happened in Brent is mirrored across the country. Staggeringly, as a black man, David is nearly three times more likely to die from Covid-19. What is it about being black that puts David at such an increased risk? Dr Singh explains that a big risk factor is the job that you do. Key workers risk their lives, exposing themselves to the virus as they keep the country running.\\n\\nYet people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds are more likely to do these jobs. David visits Tamira, whose father was one of the first members of NHS staff to die from Covid-19. She believes not enough was done to protect him at work. A heart-wrenching but all too common story. \\n\\nBut why do so many people from minority communities do these frontline jobs? David visits his sister Sandra in Birmingham, where they both grew up. They discuss their parents’ experiences as new migrants to the UK in the 50s, and how your skin colour still impacts your chances of getting a job you want. This discrimination keeps whole sections of society at the bottom of the ladder, a process known as systemic racism. \\n\\nMoving on from how people catch Covid-19, David visits Dr Marina Soltan, a respiratory doctor whose research shows that patients with chronic conditions such as hypertension or kidney disease are nearly twice as likely to die from Covid-19, and that many patients with these conditions come from deprived areas. \\n\\nBut how can where you live affect your health? Not just in terms of Covid-19 but a range of other diseases? David meets Andrew Grieve, an air quality expert from Kings College London, who reveals how air pollution can harm every organ in your body, and that the lower your household income is, the greater your exposure to air pollution.\\n\\nThe consequences of this can be devastating. Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah lost her nine-year-old daughter Ella in 2013 to a fatal asthma attack. After discovering that Ella’s most severe attacks coincided with local spikes in pollution, she began campaigning to get air pollution listed as a cause of her daughter’s death. In a landmark ruling in December 2020, the coroner found in her favour, the first time ever that air quality has been acknowledged as a cause of death in the UK.\\n\\nIt is becoming increasingly clear to David that deprivation can have a huge impact on health, and that people of colour are proportionately more likely to live in deprived conditions. But are environmental factors the only explanation for this disparity? Academic Dr Jenny Douglas shares research that black women are five times more likely to die during pregnancy and childbirth than their white counterparts, and that many of the women she has interviewed for her research felt their concerns were not listened to by health professionals.\\n\\nDavid is gradually moving to the unhappy conclusion that systemic racism, be it conscious or unconscious, could be contributing to poorer health outcomes. But a radical theory developed by American professor Arline Geronimus suggests that living with racism can actually have a physiological impact on the body, meaning that black patients age faster and suffer from poor health much earlier - a process she calls 'weathering'. It is a shocking revelation.\\n\\nConvinced that if there is to be an improvement in the health outcomes for black patients, the role racism plays needs to be acknowledged, David interviews Kemi Badenoch, the government’s minister for equalities. He wants to know why she has dismissed the idea racism might have played a role in putting black and minority ethnic communities at risk from Covid-19. \\n\\nHe ends his journey frustrated but with some hope. The stark inequalities exposed by Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement have come together at a pivotal time, one he believes can be a moment of change.\",\n  'category': 'Documentary',\n  'channel': 'bbc_one',\n  'language': False,\n  'release_date': '9pm 2 Mar 2021',\n  'duration_sec': 3525,\n  'topic': 'lifestyle'},\n {'id': 989,\n  'title': 'Sacred Wonders',\n  'description': 'In Iraq a young Yazedi woman goes in search of salvation after being traumatised by war.
